Users can mute users they do not wish to interact with, block accounts from viewing their posts, and remove accounts from their followers list. Users can post via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries. Users may subscribe to other users\\' posts—this is known as \"following\" and subscribers are known as \"followers\" or \"tweeps\", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps. Individual posts can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a \"repost\". In 2015, Twitter launched \"quote tweet\" (originally called \"retweet with comment\"), a feature that allows users to add a comment to their post, imbedding one post in the other. Users can also \"like\" (formerly \"favorite\") individual tweets.The counters for \"likes\", \"reposts\", and replies appear next to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and reposts exist on a post\\'s standalone page too. Since September 2020, quote tweets, formerly known as \"retweet with comment\", have their own counter on their post page. Until the legacy desktop front end that was discontinued in 2020, a row with miniature profile pictures of up to ten liking or retweeting users was displayed (earliest documented implementation in December 2011 overhaul), as well as a tweet reply counter next to the according button on a tweet\\'s page.Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phones either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets. Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client. Twitter announced in a tweet on September 1, 2022, that the ability to edit a tweet was being tested for select users. The company said the feature was being tested first to determine whether it could be abused. Editing would be allowed for 30 minutes, and previous versions of an edited post would be available. Eventually, all Twitter Blue subscribers would be able to use the feature.Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a \"#\" sign. Similarly, the \"@\" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users. In 2014, Twitter introduced hashflags, special hashtags that automatically generate a custom emoji next to them for a certain period of time. Hashflags may be generated by Twitter themselves or be purchased by corporations. To repost a message from another X user and share it with one\\'s own followers, a user can click the repost button within the post. Users can reply to other accounts\\' replies. Users can hide replies to their messages and select who can reply to each of their tweets before sending them: anyone, accounts who follow the poster, specific accounts, and none.The original, strict 140 character limit was gradually relaxed. In 2016, Twitter announced that attachments, links, and media such as photos, videos, and the person\\'s handle, would no longer count; a user photo post used to count for around 24 characters. In 2017, Twitter handles were similarly excluded. The same year, Twitter doubled its historical 140-character-limitation to 280. Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from. In 2023, Twitter announced that Twitter Blue users could create posts with up to 4,000 characters in length.\\nt.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter. It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use. All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper. Twitter intended the service to protect users from malicious sites, and to use it to track clicks on links within tweets. Twitter had previously used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly.In June 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com.

Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.

Images that have a description will feature a badge that says ALT in the bottom left corner, which will bring up the description when clicked.In 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not personally identified. In Twitter\\'s early years, users could communicate with Twitter using SMS. Twitter discontinued this feature in most countries in April 2023, after hackers had exposed vulnerabilities in the feature.\\n\\n\\n=== Non-tweet content ===\\nIn 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting various events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions during the U.S. presidential campaign, and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFL games in 2016. During an event in New York in May 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners. Twitter announced a number of new and expanded partnerships for its streaming video services at the event, including Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, Cheddar, IMG Fashion, Live Nation Entertainment, Major League Baseball, MTV and BET, NFL Network, the PGA Tour, The Players\\' Tribune, Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens\\' Propagate, The Verge, Stadium and the WNBA. as of the first quarter of 2017, Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.Twitter Spaces is a social audio feature that enables users to host or participate in a live-audio virtual environment called space for conversation. A maximum of 13 people are allowed onstage. The feature was initially limited to users with at least 600 followers, but since October 2021, any Twitter user can create a Space.In March 2020, Twitter began to test a stories feature known as \"fleets\" in some markets, which officially launched on November 17, 2020. Fleets could contain text and media, are only accessible for 24 hours after they are posted, and are accessed within the Twitter app; Twitter announced it would start implementing advertising into fleets in June 2021. Fleets were removed in August 2021; Twitter had intended for fleets to encourage more users to tweet regularly, but instead they were generally used by already-active users.\\n\\n\\n=== Curation ===\\n\\n\\n==== Trending topics ====\\n\\nA word, phrase, or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a \"trending topic\". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic. These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people\\'s opinions are about it. The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page, along with sponsored content.\\nTrending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and One Direction, and novel series Twilight and Harry Potter. Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success. Twitter also censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive.', start_char_idx=28678, end_char_idx=33168, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=36.0),\n",

Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites, including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as \\'@mentions\\' and \\'Retweets\\' above the Twitter stream, while \\'Messages\\' and \\'Log Out\\' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the \"New Twitter experience\" had been rolled out to all users. In 2019, Twitter was announced to be the 10th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the \"Old Twitter\". However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous \"retro\" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20. On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the \"Fly\" design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising. In addition to the Home tab, the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets. The site\\'s layout has been compared to that of Facebook. On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership. Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter\\'s real-time news feeds. Twitter\\'s director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go. On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday by announcing that it had 140 million users, a 40% rise from September 2011, who were sending 340 million tweets per day.On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users.\\nOn January 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Crashlytics in order to build out its mobile developer products. On April 18, 2013, Twitter launched a music app called Twitter Music for the iPhone. On August 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Trendrr, followed by the acquisition of MoPub on September 9, 2013. As of September 2013, the company\\'s data showed that 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices.During Super Bowl XLVII on February 3, 2013, when the power went out in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome Mondelez International, Kraft Foods vice president Lisa Mann was asked to tweet, \"You can still dunk in the dark\", referring to Oreo cookies. She approved, and as she told Ad Age in 2020, \"literally the world [had] changed when I woke up the next morning.\" This became a milestone in the development of commenting daily on culture.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014–2020 ===\\nIn April 2014, Twitter underwent a redesign that made the site resemble Facebook somewhat, with a profile picture and biography in a column left to the timeline, and a full-width header image with parallax scrolling effect.

Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to \"protected\" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers. Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy. The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands. Advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user.\\nTwitter launched the beta version of their \"Verified Accounts\" service on June 11, 2009, allowing people with public profiles to announce their account name. The profile pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, \"... it\\'s our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so.\"In May 2011, a claimant known as \"CTB\" in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc. took action against Twitter at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, requesting that the company release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about professional footballer Ryan Giggs\\'s private life. This led to the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy and the \"super-injunction\". Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do \"bad things\" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so. He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for \"illegal activity\" on the site.Twitter acquired Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses, in January 2012. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website. Twitter also offered a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country, before deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries. The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18, 2012. The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif (\"a good Jew\").Followed the sharing of images showing the killing of American journalist James Foley in 2014, Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and \"authorized individuals\".In 2015, following updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside the United States were legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter, Inc. The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection lawsOn April 8, 2020, Twitter announced that users outside of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom (thus subject to GDPR) will no longer be allowed to opt out of sharing \"mobile app advertising measurements\" to Twitter third-party partners.On October 9, 2020, Twitter took additional steps to counter misleading campaigns ahead of the 2020 US Election. Twitter\\'s new temporary update encouraged users to \"add their own commentary\" before retweeting a tweet, by making \\'quoting tweet\\' a mandatory feature instead of optional. The social network giant aimed at generating context and encouraging the circulation of more thoughtful content. After limited results, the company ended this experiment in December 2020.On May 25, 2022, Twitter was fined $150 million for collecting users\\' phone numbers and email addresses used for security and using them for targeted advertising, required to notify its users, and banned from profiting from \\'deceptively collected data\\'.', start_char_idx=65836, end_char_idx=70062, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=31.0),\n",

Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\" Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Twitter staff received the festival\\'s Web Award prize with the remark \"we\\'d like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!\"The company experienced rapid initial growth. In 2009, Twitter won the \"Breakout of the Year\" Webby Award. On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it \"a new form of social interaction\". In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day. By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications. As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter. As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily. As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.\\nTwitter\\'s usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14, 2010. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers\\' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17, 2010, and then again at the close of Japan\\'s victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second. The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women\\'s World Cup Final between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published. When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words \"Michael Jackson\" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour. The current record as of August 3, 2013, was set in Japan, with 143,199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky (beating the previous record of 33,388, also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie).The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010. By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts\\' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 \"tweetups\", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants\\' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.\\nTwitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010.

A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. An April 2017 a statista.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the tenth most used social network based on their count of 319 million monthly visitors. Its global user base in 2017 was 328 million.\\n\\n\\n=== Demographics ===\\n\\nIn 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter. According to comScore only 11% of Twitter\\'s users were aged 12 to 17. According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009, women made up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men—53% over 47%. It also stated that 5% of users accounted for 75% of all activity. According to Quancast, 27 million people in the US used Twitter in September 2009; 63% of Twitter users were under 35 years old; 60% of Twitter users were Caucasian, but a higher than average (compared to other Internet properties) were African American/black (16%) and Hispanic (11%); 58% of Twitter users have a total household income of at least US$60,000. The prevalence of African American Twitter usage and in many popular hashtags has been the subject of research studies.Twitter grew from 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) in September 2011, to 255 million in March 2014, and  more than 330 million in early 2019. In 2013, there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million tweets every day. A 2016 Pew research poll found that Twitter is used by 24% of all online US adults. It was equally popular with men and women (24% and 25% of online Americans respectively), but more popular with younger generations (36% of 18–29 year olds). A 2019 survey conducted by the Pew Foundation found that Twitter users are three times as likely to be younger than 50 years old, with the median age of adult U.S. users being 40. The survey found that 10% of users who are most active on Twitter are responsible for 80% of all tweets.\\n\\n\\n=== Content ===\\nSan Antonio-based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets (originating from the United States and in English) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm (CST) and separated them into six categories. Pointless babble made up 40%, with 38% being conversational. Pass-along value had 9%, self-promotion 6% with spam and news each making 4%.\\nDespite Jack Dorsey\\'s own open contention that a message on Twitter is \"a short burst of inconsequential information\", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labeled \"pointless babble\" is better characterized as \"social grooming\" or \"peripheral awareness\" (which she justifies as persons \"want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn\\'t viable\"). Similarly, a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers.\\n\\n\\n=== Levels of use ===\\nAccording to research published in April 2014, around 44% of user accounts have never tweeted. About 22% of Americans say they have ever used Twitter, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey. In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users. Noting how demographics of Twitter users differ from the average Americans, commentators have cautioned against media narratives that treat Twitter as representative of the population, adding that only 10% of users Tweet actively, and that 90% of Twitter users have Tweeted no more than twice. In 2016, shareholders sued Twitter, alleging it \"artificially inflated its stock price by misleading them about user engagement\".

Twitter also removed accounts linked to the governments of Armenia, Egypt, Cuba, Serbia, Honduras, Indonesia and Iran. Twitter suspended Pakistani accounts tied to government officials for posting tweets about the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. In February 2021, Twitter removed accounts in India that criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s government for its conduct during Indian farmers\\' protests in 2020–2021.At the start of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, numerous tweets reported false medical information related to the pandemic. Twitter announced a new policy in which they would label tweets containing misinformation going forward. In April 2020, Twitter removed accounts which defended President Rodrigo Duterte\\'s response to the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines.In November 2020, then Chief Technology Officer and future CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal, when asked by MIT Technology Review about balancing the protection of free speech as a core value and the endeavour to combat misinformation, said: \"Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation ... focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed.\"Musk had been critical of Twitter\\'s moderation of misinformation prior to his acquisition of the company. After the transition, Musk eliminated the misinformation moderation team, and stopped enforcing its policy on labeling tweets with misleading information about coronavirus. While Twitter had joined a voluntary program under the European Union\\'s to fight disinformation in June 2022, Musk pulled the company out of the program in May 2023.\\n\\n\\n=== Community Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Court cases and lawsuits ===\\nTwitter Inc. v. Taamneh, alongside Gonzalez v. Google, were heard by the United States Supreme Court during its 2022–2023 term. Both cases dealt with Internet content providers and whether they are liable for terrorism-related information posted by their users. In the case of Twitter v. Taamneh, the case asked if Twitter and other social media services are liable for user-generated terrorism content under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and are beyond their Section 230 protections. The court ruled in May 2023 that the charges brought against Twitter and other companies were not permissible under the Antiterrorism Act, and did not address the Section 230 question. This decision also supported the Court\\'s per curiam decision in Gonzalez returning that case to the lower court for review in light of the Twitter decision.In 2016, Twitter shareholder Doris Shenwick filed a lawsuit against Twitter, Inc., claiming executives misled investors over the company\\'s growth prospects. In 2021, Twitter agreed to pay $809.5 million to settle.In May 2022, Twitter agreed to pay $150 million to settle a lawsuit started by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit concerned Twitter\\'s use of email addresses and phone numbers of Twitter users to target advertisements at them. The company also agreed to third-party audits of its data privacy program.On November 3, 2022, on the eve of expected lay-offs, a group of Twitter employees based in San Francisco and Cambridge filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Naming five current or former workers as plaintiffs, the suit accused the company of violating federal and state laws that govern notice of employment termination.

The service\\'s API allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter. Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006. The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials.From 2006 until 2010, Twitter\\'s developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community. In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice. Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known third-party developers. And in 2012, Twitter introduced stricter usage limits for its API, \"completely crippling\" some developers. While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.In July 2020, Twitter released version 2.0 of the public API and began showcasing Twitter apps made by third-party developers on its Twitter Toolbox section in April 2022.In January 2023, Twitter ended third party access to its APIs, forcing all third party Twitter clients to shut down. This was controversial among the developer community, as many third-party apps predated the company\\'s official apps, and the change was not announced beforehand. Twitterrific\\'s Sean Heber confirmed in a blog post that the 16-year-old app has been discontinued. \"We are sorry to say that the app\\'s sudden and undignified demise is due to an unannounced and undocumented policy change by an increasingly capricious Twitter – a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy nor want to work with any longer.\"In February 2023, Twitter announced it would be ending free access to Twitter API, and began offering paid tier plans with a more limited access.\\n\\n\\n=== Innovators patent agreement ===\\nOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an \"Innovators Patent Agreement\" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes.\\n\\n\\n=== Open source ===\\nTwitter has a history of both using and releasing open-source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service. A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open-source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala. Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager. The popular Bootstrap frontend framework was also started at Twitter and is 10th most popular repository on GitHub.On March 31, 2023, Twitter released the source code for Twitter\\'s recommendation algorithm, which determines what tweets show up on the user\\'s personal timeline, to GitHub. According to Twitter\\'s blog post: \"We believe that we have a responsibility, as the town square of the internet, to make our platform transparent. So today we are taking the first step in a new era of transparency and opening much of our source code to the global community.\" CEO Elon Musk had been promising the move for a while — on March 24, 2022, before he owned the site, he polled his followers about whether Twitter\\'s algorithm should be open source, and around 83 percent of the responses said \"yes\".

The platform also was increasingly used for misinformation related to the pandemic. Twitter started marking tweets which contained misleading information, and adding links to fact-checks.  In May 2020, Twitter moderators marked two tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump as \"potentially misleading\" and linked to a fact-check. Trump responded by signing an executive order to weaken Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits social media sites\\' liability for content moderation decisions. Twitter later banned Trump, claiming that he violated \"the glorification of violence policy\". The ban drew criticism from conservatives and European leaders, who saw it as an interference on freedom of speech.On June 5, 2021, the Nigerian government issued an indefinite ban on Twitter usage in the country, citing \"misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences\", after the platform removed tweets made by the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.  Nigeria\\'s ban was criticized by Amnesty International.In 2021, Twitter began the research phase of Bluesky, an open source decentralized social media protocol where users can choose which algorithmic curation they want. The same year, Twitter also released Twitter Spaces, a social audio feature; \"super follows\", a way to subscribe to creators for exclusive content; and a beta of \"ticketed Spaces\", which makes access to certain audio rooms paid. Twitter unveiled a redesign in August 2021, with adjusted colors and a new Chirp font, which improves the left-alignment of most Western languages.\\n\\n\\n=== Since 2022 ===\\nIn June 2022, Twitter announced a partnership with e-commerce giant Shopify, and its plans to launch a sales channel app for U.S. Shopify merchants.On August 23, 2022, the contents of a whistleblower complaint by former information security head Peiter Zatko to the United States Congress were published. Zatko had been fired by Twitter in January 2022. The complaint alleges that Twitter failed to disclose several data breaches, had negligent security measures, violated United States securities regulations, and broke the terms of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over the safeguarding of user data. The report also claims that the Indian government forced Twitter to hire one of its agents to gain direct access to user data.\\n\\n\\n==== Acquisition by Elon Musk ====\\n\\n\\n==== Post-acquisition ====\\n\\nA week after the takeover, Musk revamped Twitter Blue, increasing its price to $8 per month and adding new features, including the \"blue checkmark\" verification that had previously been reserved for high-profile confirmed users. This plan was criticized by several outlets, fearing that the potential for misinformation would increase since anyone could pay to appear to be verified through Twitter Blue. Musk opted to delay the changes to blue checkmarks until after the 2022 United States elections over these concerns and stated that accounts that were faking identities, outside of parody accounts, would be terminated. Following the takeover, various brands and companies paused advertising on the platform.In December 2022, Musk provided internal documentation to a number of independent journalists and writers including Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger which was then publicly disseminated through a series of posts known as the \"Twitter Files\". The files describe internal discussion as related to Twitter\\'s moderation steps in events such as the breaking of the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, shadow banning of some conservative commentators\\' accounts, and the decision to block Trump. While some on the right saw the documents as evidence of Twitter\\'s liberal bias and hostility to free speech, many people on the left described them as a reflection of how difficult it is for social media platforms to make tough decisions about content moderation.The Twitter accounts of a number of journalists were permanently suspended on December 15, 2022. These journalists, including Mashable\\'s Matt Binder, Aaron Rupar, Ryan Mac of The New York Times, and CNN\\'s Donie O\\'Sullivan, had covered Twitter and recently had written articles about Musk\\'s takeover. Several of the reporters had tweeted about the controversy over Musk\\'s banning of ElonJet and other accounts which track private jets. In response, Twitter Head of Trust and Safety Ella Irwin told The Verge that \"we will suspend any accounts that violate our privacy policies and put other users at risk\". Binder denied violating any of Twitter\\'s policies, saying: \"I did not share any location data, as per Twitter\\'s new terms.

Jourova stated: \"Elon Musk should be aware of that. There are red lines. And sanctions, soon.\"  On December 17, 2022, several banned journalists\\' accounts were reinstated.On December 18, 2022, Twitter announced that it was banning users linking to what was referred to as \"prohibited platforms\" including Facebook, Mastodon, Instagram and Truth Social, as well as third party link aggregators such as Linktree. Six hours after his announcement, Musk tweeted: \"Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won\\'t happen again.\" It is unclear if the earlier policy will be reversed. He also tweeted a poll asking users if he should remain as head of Twitter promising to abide by its results, in which 57.5% of the 17.5m votes were in favour of him stepping down. On December 20, 2022, Musk announced he would step down as CEO once a replacement had been found, and that he would then run the software and servers teams. Linda Yaccarino resigned from NBCUniversal on May 12, 2023, and on the same day Musk announced that Yaccarino would be the new chief executive officer of X Corp. and Twitter.Since the acquisition, Twitter\\'s stability has been called into question, with reports that Musk had \"disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks\" in a data center used by Twitter, just before a large-scale outage of the platform occurred in December 2022. In 2023, many alternative third-party Twitter clients including Tweetbot, stopped working without warning and without any apparent explanation from the company. Later, Twitter announced it was \"enforcing long-standing API rules\" and retroactively changed its Developer Terms of Service afterward to justify its unannounced banning of third-party Twitter clients.In January 2023, The Guardian stated that Twitter reportedly needed to pay $300m in interest on debts, and a default could lead to bankruptcy. Advertising revenue, comprising over 90% of Twitter\\'s turnover had fallen strongly. This happened because clients were concerned about moderation standards after Musk\\'s takeover and also due to a miscalculated restart of its subscription service, leading to many falsely \"verified\" corporate accounts. Advertising had not improved and Twitter\\'s daily revenue had fallen by 40%.\\nOn March 23, 2023, Twitter announced that \"legacy\" verification badges would be removed starting on April 1: this date passed with no change before Twitter and Musk both announced (at different dates) that the removal date for checkmarks from non-paying accounts was April 20. The only way to acquire a blue checkmark would be through the paid Twitter Blue subscription.As of mid-April, Twitter no longer allows searching tweets without an account. On June 30, 2023, Twitter blocked unregistered users from viewing tweets or profiles on the platform. This not only blocked unregistered users from accessing tweets, but it also prevented search engines from indexing its pages, resulting in a loss of over half of its indexed URLs in the past few days. Musk described the change as a \"temporary emergency measure\" on his own profile, blaming \"several hundred organizations\" for scraping data from the site. The following day further measures were implemented with temporary limits to the amount of tweets a user can see per day, with verified users having 6,000, unverified users having 600 and newly created users having 300. This limit was later increased to 8,000 for verified users, 800 for unverified users, and 400 for new accounts. Around three hours after this announcement, the limit was once again raised to 10,000 for verified users, 1,000 for unverified users, and 500 for new accounts.', start_char_idx=17177, end_char_idx=21461, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=27.0),\n",

Critics considered the redesign an attempt to emulate features and experiences found in mobile apps and third-party Twitter clients.The new layout was revised in 2011 with a focus on continuity with the web and mobile versions, introducing \"Connect\" (interactions with other users such as replies) and \"Discover\" (further information regarding trending topics and news headlines) tabs, an updated profile design, and moving all content to the right pane (leaving the left pane dedicated to functions and the trending topics list). In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu, the first right-to-left language versions of the site. In 2023 the Twitter Web site listed 34 languages supported by Twitter.com.In September 2012, a new layout for profiles was introduced, with larger \"covers\" that could be customized with a custom header image, and a display of the user\\'s recent photos posted. The \"Discover\" tab was discontinued in April 2015, and was succeeded on the mobile app by an \"Explore\" tab—which features trending topics and moments.In September 2018, Twitter began to migrate selected web users to its progressive web app (based on its Twitter Lite experience for mobile web), reducing the interface to two columns. Migrations to this iteration of Twitter increased in April 2019, with some users receiving it with a modified layout.In July 2019, Twitter officially released this redesign, with no further option to opt-out while logged in. It is designed to further-unify Twitter\\'s user experience between the web and mobile application versions, adopting a three-column layout with a sidebar containing links to common areas (including \"Explore\" that has been merged with the search page) which previously appeared in a horizontal top bar, profile elements such as picture and header images and biography texts merged into the same column as the timeline, and features from the mobile version (such as multi-account support, and an opt-out for the \"top tweets\" mode on the timeline).\\n\\n\\n=== Security ===\\nIn response to early Twitter security breaches, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users\\' private information, including maintenance of a \"comprehensive information security program\" to be independently audited biannually.After a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts, including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian, in April 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking.On July 15, 2020, a major hack of Twitter affected 130 high-profile accounts, both verified and unverified ones such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk; the hack allowed bitcoin scammers to send tweets via the compromised accounts that asked the followers to send bitcoin to a given public address, with the promise to double their money. Within a few hours, Twitter disabled tweeting and reset passwords from all verified accounts. Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts\\' personal details as to gain access as part of a \"smash and grab\" attempt to make money quickly, with an estimated US$120,000 in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened. Several law enforcement entities including the FBI launched investigations into the attack.On August 5, 2022, Twitter disclosed that a bug introduced in a June 2021 update to the service allowed threat actors to link email addresses and phone numbers to twitter user\\'s accounts. The bug was reported through Twitter\\'s bug bounty program in January 2022 and subsequently fixed. While Twitter originally believed no one had taken advantage of the vulnerability, it was later revealed that a user on the online hacking forum Breached Forums had used the vulnerability to compile a list of over 5.4 million user profiles, which they offered to sell for $30,000.

Twitter disputed the claim, stating that \"violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear\". The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, upholding the Section 230 safe harbor, which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users. The lawsuit was revised in August 2016, providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices.Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics in May 2016, sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech. Following public outcry, Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had been suspended. The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review \"[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech\" posted on their services within 24 hours. In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned 235,000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism.On May 10, 2019, Twitter announced that they suspended 166,513 accounts for promoting terrorism in the July–December 2018 period, stating there was a steady decrease in terrorist groups trying to use the platform owing to its \"zero-tolerance policy enforcement\". According to Vijaya Gadde, Legal, Policy and Trust and Safety Lead at Twitter, there was a reduction of 19% terror related tweets from the previous reporting period (January–June 2018).As of July 30, 2020, Twitter will block URLs in tweets that point to external websites that contain malicious content (such as malware and phishing content) as well or hate speech, speech encouraging violence, terrorism, child sexual exploitation, breaches of privacy, and other similar content that is already banned as part of the content of tweets on the site. Users that frequently point to such sites may have their accounts suspended. Twitter said this was to bring their policy in line to prevent users from bypassing their tweet content restrictions by simply linking to the banned content.Following the onset of protests by Donald Trump\\'s supporters across the US in January 2021, Twitter suspended more than 70,000 accounts, stating that they shared \"harmful QAnon-associated content\" at a large scale, and were \"dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service\". The rioters that broke into the U.S. Capitol included a large number of QAnon followers.\\n\\n\\n=== Malicious and fake accounts ===\\nBetween January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations.In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.In December 2019, Twitter removed 5,929 accounts for violating their manipulation policies. The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated in Saudi Arabia. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior. However, Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.In March 2021, Twitter suspended around 3,500 fake accounts that were running a campaign to influence the American audience, after the US intelligence officials concluded that the assassination of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was \"approved\" by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. These Saudi accounts were working in two languages, English and Arabic, to influence public opinion around the issue. Many accounts commented directly on the tweets of US-based media houses, including The Post, CNN, CBS News and The Los Angeles Times. Twitter was unable to identify the source of the influence campaign.As of 2022, the top four countries spreading state-linked Twitter misinformation are Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia.', start_char_idx=73135, end_char_idx=78016, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=25.0),\n",

It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter\\'s ability to track epidemics and how they spread. Additionally Twitter serves as a real-time sensor for natural disasters such as bush fires and earthquakes.\\n\\n\\n==== Education ====\\nTwitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities. It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions, especially in large-lecture courses. Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom. By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education. A broad example of a hashtag used in education is \"edchat\", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag. Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades. In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is, another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally, 93% said they use Twitter because it is free. People found sifting through large amounts of data to be challenging; however, with the simple nature of Twitter, large amount of information became easily accessible. Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates. These features help to promote education outside the classroom in a global setting where students and educators are easily able to create, connect, and share knowledge. This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.\\n\\n\\n==== Public figures ====\\nJonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that \"the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.\" In that same vein, and with Sigmund Freud in mind, political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well-crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader\\'s personality: the id, ego, and superego. The poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled Selected Tweets featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years. The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called \"Some Contemporary Characters\", composed entirely of tweets.Many commentators have suggested that Twitter radically changed the format of reporting due to instant, short, and frequent communication. According to The Atlantic writers Benjamin M. Reilly and Robinson Meyer, Twitter has an outsized impact on the public discourse and media. \"Something happens on Twitter; celebrities, politicians and journalists talk about it, and it\\'s circulated to a wider audience by Twitter\\'s algorithms; journalists write about the dustup.\" This can lead to an argument on a Twitter feed looking like a \"debate roiling the country... regular people are left with a confused, agitated view of our current political discourse\". In a 2018 article in the Columbia Journalism Review, Matthew Ingram argued much the same about Twitter\\'s \"oversized role\" and that it promotes immediacy over newsworthiness. In some cases, inauthentic and provocative tweets were taken up as common opinion in mainstream articles.

US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum\\'s Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers. However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.\\n\\n\\n==== Religion ====\\nAs of October 2015, more than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals managed active Twitter accounts, nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave.

As of April 2022, his successor, Pope Francis, has 18.7 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship and moderation ===\\n\\nTwitter is banned completely in Russia, Iran, China and North Korea, and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Turkey, Venezuela and Turkmenistan on different bases. In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel. In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany. Twitter stated that between July 1 and December 31, 2018, \"We received legal demands relating to 27,283 accounts from 47 different countries, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, and Slovenia for the first time.\" As part of evidence to a U.S. Senate Enquiry, the company admitted that their systems \"detected and hid\" several hundred thousand tweets relating to the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak. During the curfew in Jammu and Kashmir after revocation of its autonomous status on August 5, 2019, the Indian government approached Twitter to block accounts accused of spreading anti-India content; by October 25, nearly one million tweets had been removed as a result.In March 2022, shortly after Russia\\'s censorship of Twitter, a Tor onion service link was created by the platform to allow people to access the website, even in countries with heavy Internet censorship.', start_char_idx=92636, end_char_idx=95772, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=24.0),\n",

The \"super-follow\" feature is said to enable competition with the subscription site OnlyFans, used mainly by sex workers. Content filtering services for families and schools have noted that the company makes \"it really easy to find\" porn, and advise blocking the entire domain. Many performers use Twitter\\'s service to market and grow their porn businesses, attracting users to paywalled services like OnlyFans by distributing photos and short video clips as advertisements.\\nIn April 2022, Twitter convened a \"Red Team\" for the project of ACM, \"Adult Content Monetization\", as it is known internally. Eventually the project was abandoned, because of the difficulty of implementing Real ID.\\n\\n\\n==== Child sexual exploitation ====\\nA February 2021 report from the company\\'s Health team begins, \"While the amount of CSE (child sexual exploitation) online has grown exponentially, Twitter\\'s investment in technologies to detect and manage the growth has not.\"\\nUntil February 2022, the only way for users to flag illegal content was to flag it as \"sensitive media\" — a broad category that left much of the worst material not prioritized for moderation. In a February report, employees wrote that Twitter along with other Tech Companies have \"accelerated the pace of CSE content creation and distribution to a breaking point where manual detection, review, and investigations no longer scale\" by allowing pornography and failing to invest in systems that could effectively monitor it. The working group made several recommendations, but they were not taken up and the group was disbanded.\\nAs part of its efforts to monetize porn, Twitter held an internal investigation that reported in April 2022, \"Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale.\"John Doe et al. vs. Twitter, a civil lawsuit filed in the 9th Circuit Court, alleges that Twitter benefited from sex trafficking and refused to remove the illegal tweets when first informed of them. In an amicus brief filed in the case, the NCMEC said, \"The children informed the company that they were minors, that they had been \\'baited, harassed, and threatened\\' into making the videos, that they were victims of \\'sex abuse\\' under investigation by law enforcement\" but Twitter failed to remove the videos, \"allowing them to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of the platform\\'s users\".Some major brands including Dyson, Mazda, Forbes, and PBS Kids suspended their marketing campaigns and pulled their ads from the platform, after an investigation into child porn on twitter showed that Twitter failed to suspend 70% of the accounts that shared or solicited the prohibited content. A brand president at Cole Haan said, \"We\\'re horrified ... either Twitter is going to fix this, or we\\'ll fix it by any means we can, which includes not buying Twitter ads.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Impact ===\\n\\n\\n==== On communication ====\\nIn May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter \"elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel too connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they\\'re having for dinner.\" The following year, John C. Dvorak described Twitter as \"the new CB radio\".In April 2023, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York City announced that it would no longer post real-time service updates on Twitter. The transportation system claimed that the platform cannot be trusted to provide consistent updates that riders need. According to an MTA spokesperson, this decision was made after it experienced two Application Programming Interface (API) interruptions over the previous two weeks. However, only the updates were discontinued and the MTA planned to continue to respond to riders\\' queries.In 2023, Twitter introduced a paywall system that required businesses to pay for access to its platform. The payment scheme\\'s upper limit amounts to an annual fee of up to $2.5 million for top-tier access. With the paywall implementation, public agencies issued numerous alerts about potential interruptions to transit and weather alerts. Shanifah Rieara, MTA Acting Chief Customer Officer, revealed that Twitter attempted to demand over $500,000 annually from MTA for platform access, which the latter declined.\\nOn May 4, 2023, Twitter backtracked its paywall system, allowing the free posting of automated tweets by verified government profiles.

Maria Zakharova for the Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a \"gross violation\" by the US of free speech.In October 2019, Twitter announced it would stop running political ads on its ad platform effective November 22. This resulted from several spurious claims made by political ads. Company CEO Dorsey clarified that internet advertising had great power and was extremely effective for commercial advertisers, the power brings significant risks to politics where crucial decisions impact millions of lives. The company reversed the ban in August 2023, publishing criteria governing political advertising which do not allow the promotion of false or misleading content, and requiring advertisers to comply with laws, with compliance being the sole responsibility of the advertiser.In April 2022, Twitter announced a ban on \"misleading\" advertisements that go against \"the scientific consensus on climate change\". While the company did not give full guidelines, it stated that the decisions would be made with the help of \"authoritative sources\", including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\n\\n\\n=== Fines ===\\nTwitter, and X, has been fined several times for non-compliance with laws and regulations. On May 25, 2022, Twitter was fined $150 million by the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice for collecting users\\' contact details and using them for targeted advertising.In August 2023, Twitter was fined US$350,000 for failing to meet two deadlines to comply with a U.S. Department of Justice search warrant for the account of former president Donald Trump.In October 2023, X was fined AU$610,500 by Australia\\'s e-Safety Commission for failing to properly disclose information about how it polices child abuse content.As of 2023 other fines were being considered.\\n\\n\\n== Technology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Implementation ===\\nTwitter relies on open-source software. The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework, deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.From Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling. Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200 to 300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter\\'s engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs called snowflakes, and geolocation data is added using \\'Rockdove\\'. The URL shortener t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives an acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.On August 16, 2013, Raffi Krikorian, Twitter\\'s vice president of platform engineering, shared in a blog post that the company\\'s infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record.

Musk described the change as a \"temporary emergency measure\" on his own profile, blaming \"several hundred organizations\" for scraping data from the site. The following day further measures were implemented with temporary limits to the amount of tweets a user can see per day, with verified users having 6,000, unverified users having 600 and newly created users having 300. This limit was later increased to 8,000 for verified users, 800 for unverified users, and 400 for new accounts. Around three hours after this announcement, the limit was once again raised to 10,000 for verified users, 1,000 for unverified users, and 500 for new accounts. After July 4, Twitter removed the block for unregistered users to view tweets and profiles; however, the ability to view threads and more than one tweet in a single page still requires an account.Analysis conducted by research firm Sensor Tower found that global active daily users of the platform via mobile apps had steadily declined during the year after Musk acquired the company, down 16% by September 2023, while the metric showed positive growth for five other major social media platforms. By December 2023, loss of advertising revenue had become so extreme that public media speculation suggested that Twitter would become bankrupt. Accusations of uncontrolled antisemitism on the platform led to many advertisers withdrawing.\\n\\n\\n==== Rebrand to X ====\\nFollowing Twitter\\'s change in ownership, speculations of an upcoming rebrand began as Musk began referring to the platform as \"X/Twitter\" and \"X (Twitter)\", and renamed several features, including Birdwatch to Community Notes and Quote Tweets to Quotes. On July 23, 2023, Musk teased that the platform would receive a rebrand, beginning with a new logo based around the letter X. He later tweeted that if he found a logo, the rebrand would be implemented the next day. Subsequently, he tweeted a video of the Twitter logo glitching into an abstract X logo.Later that day, Musk confirmed the rebrand, which started when the x.com domain (formerly associated with PayPal) began redirecting to Twitter; the logo was changed from the bird to the X the next day, and the platform\\'s official main and associated accounts also began using the letter X within their handles. The @x handle was originally owned by photographer Gene X Hwang, who registered it in 2007. Hwang had expressed willingness to sell the handle, but received an email on July 25, 2023, stating that the company was taking it. He was offered some X merchandise and a meeting with the company\\'s leaders, but no financial benefits. The Android app\\'s name and icon were changed to X on Google Play by July 27; the same change went live on the App Store on July 31 after Apple granted an exception to its minimum character length of 2. Around that time, some more elements of the Twitter branding were removed from the web version, including tweets being renamed to \"posts\".The rebrand was described as unusual, given that Twitter\\'s brand was already strong internationally, with words like \"tweet\" having entered common language. The rebranding has been criticized on the basis that the trademarkability of the name and logo is weak: there are almost 900 companies in the U.S. that own an X trademark, including an existing social media-related logo owned by Meta Platforms. The X logo uses a blackboard bold X, a character that has appeared in mathematical textbooks since the 1970s and that is included in Unicode as U+1D54F 𝕏 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL X; one user of the platform also noted a similarity of the logo to the lowercase x in the Monotype font Special Alphabets 4, though Monotype has confirmed that they are not exactly alike.A few days after the rebrand took effect, an AP Stylebook update recommended that journalists refer to the platform as \"X, formerly known as Twitter\". In September 2023, Ad Age, citing The Harris Poll, noted that the rebranding had not publicly caught on, with the majority of users as well as notable brands still referring to X as \"Twitter\".\\n\\n\\n== Appearance and features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Posts ===\\n\\nPosts are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to only their followers.

Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December 2014, including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate. In February 2015, CEO Dick Costolo said he was \\'frankly ashamed\\' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.As per a research study conducted by IT for Change on abuse and misogynistic trolling on Twitter directed at Indian women in public-political life, women perceived to be ideologically left-leaning, dissenters, Muslim women, political dissenters, and political commentators and women from opposition parties received a disproportionate amount of abusive and hateful messages on Twitter.In 2016, Twitter announced the creation of the Twitter Trust & Safety Council to help \"ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter\". The council\\'s inaugural members included 50 organizations and individuals. The announcement of Twitter\\'s \"Trust & Safety Council\" was met with objection from parts of its userbase. Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards \"the restriction of hate speech\" and a Reason article expressed concern that \"there\\'s not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list\".Twitter banned 7,000 accounts and limited 150,000 more that had ties to QAnon on July 21, 2020. The bans and limits came after QAnon-related accounts began harassing other users through practices of swarming or brigading, coordinated attacks on these individuals through multiple accounts in the weeks prior. Those accounts limited by Twitter will not appear in searches nor be promoted in other Twitter functions. Twitter said they will continue to ban or limit accounts as necessary, with their support account stating \"We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know are engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension\".In September 2021, Twitter began beta testing a feature called Safety Mode. The functionality aims to limit unwelcome interactions through automated detection of negative engagements.

DeGeneres said she wanted to pay homage to Meryl Streep\\'s record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour. By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times.  On May 9, 2017, Ellen\\'s record was broken by Carter Wilkerson (@carterjwm) by collecting nearly 3.5 million retweets in a little over a month. This record was broken when Yusaku Maezawa announced a giveaway on Twitter in January 2019, accumulating 4.4 million retweets. A similar tweet he made in December 2019 was retweeted 3.8 million times.The most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter occurred on August 2, 2013; during a Japanese television airing of the Studio Ghibli film Castle in the Sky, fans simultaneously tweeted the word balse (バルス)—the incantation for a destruction spell used during its climax, after it was uttered in the film. There was a global peak of 143,199 tweets in one second, beating the previous record of 33,388.The most discussed event in Twitter history occurred on October 24, 2015; the hashtag (\"#ALDubEBTamangPanahon\") for Tamang Panahon, a live special episode of the Filipino variety show Eat Bulaga! at the Philippine Arena, centering on its popular on-air couple AlDub, attracted 41 million tweets. The most-discussed sporting event in Twitter history was the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany on July 8, 2014.According to Guinness World Records, the fastest pace to a million followers was set by actor Robert Downey Jr. in 23 hours and 22 minutes in April 2014.

A 2023 study showed that retweets are more likely to contain positive content and address larger audiences using the first-person pronoun \"we\". Replies, on the other hand, are more likely to contain negative content and address individuals using the second-person pronoun \"you\" and the third-person pronouns \"he\" or \"she\". While influencers with many followers tend to post positive messages, often using the word \"love\" when addressing larger audiences, users with less followers tend to engage in interpersonal conversations to provoke user engagement.\\n\\n\\n== Branding ==\\nWhen it was known as Twitter, X was internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo, or the Twitter Bird. The original logo, which was simply the word Twitter, was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley. A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009. This version had been named \"Larry the Bird\" after Larry Bird of the NBA\\'s Boston Celtics fame.Within a year, the Larry the Bird logo underwent a redesign by Stone and Pascuzzo to eliminate the cartoon features, leaving a solid silhouette of Larry the Bird that was used from 2010 through 2012. In 2012, Douglas Bowman created a further simplified version of Larry the Bird, keeping the solid silhouette but making it more similar to a mountain bluebird. This logo was simply called the \"Twitter Bird\" and was used until July 2023.\\nOn July 22, 2023, Elon Musk announced that the service would be re-branded to \"X\", in his pursuit of creating an \"everything app\". Musk\\'s X profile picture, along with the official X accounts, and the icons when browsing/signing up for the platform, were updated to reflect the new logo. The logo (𝕏) is a Unicode mathematical alphanumeric symbol for the letter \"X\" styled in double-strike bold.\\nMike Proulx of The New York Times was critical of this change, saying the brand value has been \"wiped out\". Mike Carr says the new logo gives a \"\\'Big Brother\\' tech overlord vibe\" in contrast to the \"cuddly\" nature of the previous bird logo. Users review bombed the newly rebranded \"X\" app on the iOS App Store on the day it was revealed, and Rolling Stone\\'s Miles Klee said that the rebrand \"reeks of desperation\".\\n\\n\\n== Finances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Revenue sources ===\\nOn April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase \"promoted tweets\" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to Google Adwords\\' advertising model. Users\\' photos can generate royalty-free revenue for Twitter, and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network (WENN) was announced in May 2011. Twitter generated an estimated US$139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011.In June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system. The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis. To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices. In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite.On August 3, 2016, Twitter launched Instant Unlock Card, a new feature that encourages people to tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network\\'s conversational ads.

Following Twitter\\'s ongoing \"X\" name change, the subscription was rebranded to X Blue (or simply Blue), and, on August 5, 2023, was rebranded to X Premium (or simply Premium). The subscription provides additional premium features to the service. In November 2023 a \"Premium+\" subscription was launched, with a higher monthly fee giving benefits such as the omission of adverts.\\n\\n\\n==== Verification of paid accounts ====\\n\\nIn November 2022, Musk announced plans to add account verification and the ability to upload longer audio and video to Twitter Blue. A previous perk offering advertising-free news articles from participating publishers was dropped, but Musk stated that Twitter did want to work with publishers on a similar \"paywall bypass\" perk. Musk had pushed for a more expensive version of Twitter Blue following his takeover, arguing that it would be needed to offset a decline in advertising revenue. Twitter states that paid verification is required to help reduce fraudulent accounts.The verification marker was included in a premium tier of Twitter Blue introduced on November 9, 2022, priced at US$7.99. On November 11, 2022, after the introduction of this feature led to prominent issues involving accounts using the feature to impersonate public figures and companies, Twitter Blue with verification was temporarily suspended. After about a month, Twitter Blue was relaunched on December 12, 2022, though for those purchasing the service through the iOS app store, the cost will be $10.99 a month as to offset the 30% revenue split that Apple takes.Twitter initially grandfathered users and entities that had gained verification due to their status as public figures, referring them as \"legacy verified accounts\" that \"may or may not be notable\". On March 25, 2023, it was announced that \"legacy\" verification status would be removed; a subscription will be required to retain verified status, costing $1,000 per-month for organizations (which are designated with a gold verified symbol), plus an additional $50 for each \"affiliate\". The change was originally scheduled for April 1, 2023, but was delayed to April 20, 2023, following criticism of the changes. Musk also announced plans for the \"For You\" timeline to prioritize verified accounts and user followers only beginning April 15, 2023, and threatened to only allow verified users to participate in polls (although the latter change has yet to occur).Effective April 21, 2023, Twitter requires companies to participate in the verified organizations program in order to purchase advertising on the platform, although companies that spend at least $1,000 on advertising per-month automatically receive membership in the program at no additional cost.From April 25, 2023, verified users are now prioritized in replies to tweets.', start_char_idx=35420, end_char_idx=38648, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=17.0),\n",

In their announcement, Twitter released two data sets detailing the core group\\'s account activity. Geng Shuang, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not comment on the suspensions but suggested that the activity could be attributed to overseas Chinese citizens.On June 12, 2020, Twitter suspended over 7,000 accounts from Turkey because those accounts were fake profiles, designed to support the Turkish president and were managed by a central authority. Turkey\\'s communication director said that the decision was illogical, biased and politically motivated. Turkey blocked access to Twitter twice, once after voice recordings appeared on Twitter in which Erdogan ordered his son to stash away millions of dollars and another time for 12 hours in the aftermath of the earthquake of February 2023, when Erdogan blamed the people of a disinformation campaign as they criticized the Government for their lack of help.In May 2021, Twitter labeled one of the tweets by Sambit Patra, a spokesman of the local ruling party BJP in India, as \"manipulated media\", leading to Twitter\\'s offices in Delhi and Gurgaon being raided by the local police. Twitter issued a statement, calling the police visit \"a form of intimidation\". Later, the Indian government released a statement in July 2021 claiming Twitter has lost its liability protection concerning user-generated content. This was brought on by Twitter\\'s failure to comply with the new IT rules introduced in 2021 with a filing stating that the company failed to appoint executives to govern user content on the platform. Twitter stated to India\\'s government in August 2021 that they have appointed permanent executives and staff to provide for compliance to these new IT rules.\\n\\n\\n==== Pornography ====\\nTwitter allows pornographic content as long as it is marked \"sensitive\" by uploaders, which puts it behind an interstice and hides it from minors. The \"super-follow\" feature is said to enable competition with the subscription site OnlyFans, used mainly by sex workers. Content filtering services for families and schools have noted that the company makes \"it really easy to find\" porn, and advise blocking the entire domain. Many performers use Twitter\\'s service to market and grow their porn businesses, attracting users to paywalled services like OnlyFans by distributing photos and short video clips as advertisements.\\nIn April 2022, Twitter convened a \"Red Team\" for the project of ACM, \"Adult Content Monetization\", as it is known internally.

This lets eligible accounts charge $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month to subscribe to the account. The launch only generated about $6,000 in its first two weeks. In 2023, the Super Follows feature was rebranded as simply \"subscriptions\", allowing users to publish exclusive long-form posts and videos for their subscribers; the pivot in marketing was reportedly intended to help compete with Substack.In May 2021, Twitter began testing a Tip Jar feature on its iOS and Android clients. The feature allows users to send monetary tips to certain accounts, providing a financial incentive for content creators on the platform. The Tip Jar is optional and users can choose whether or not to enable tips for their account. On September 23, 2021, Twitter announced that it will allow users to tip users on the social network with bitcoin. The feature will be available for iOS users. Previously, users could tip with fiat currency using services such as Square\\'s Cash App and PayPal\\'s Venmo. Twitter will integrate the Strike bitcoin lightning wallet service. It was noted that at this current time, Twitter will not take a cut of any money sent through the tips feature.On August 27, 2021, Twitter rolled out Ticketed Spaces, which let Twitter Spaces hosts charge between $1 and $999 for access to their rooms. In April 2022, Twitter announced that it will partner with Stripe, Inc. for piloting cryptocurrency payouts for limited users in the platform. Eligible users of Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows will be able to receive their earnings in the form of USD coin, a stablecoin whose value is that of the U.S. dollar. Users can also hold their earnings in crypto wallets, and then exchange them into other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n\\n=== E-commerce ===\\nFrom 2014 to 2017, Twitter offered a \"Buy button\" feature, allowing tweets to embed products that could be purchased from within the service. Users could also add their billing and shipping information directly to their accounts. The buy button\\'s platform partners at launch included Stripe, Gumroad, Musictoday, and The Fancy,In July 2021, Twitter began testing a \"Shop module\" for iOS users in the United States, allowing accounts associated with brands to display a carousel of cards on their profiles showcasing products. Unlike the Buy button, where order fulfillment was handed from within Twitter, these cards are external links to online storefronts from which the products may be purchased. In March 2022, Twitter expanded the test to allow companies to showcase up to 50 products on their profiles.In November 2021, Twitter introduced support for \"shoppable\" live streams, in which brands can hold streaming events that similarly display banners and pages highlighting products that are featured in the presentation.\\n\\n\\n== Usage ==\\n\\nDaily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts. A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. An April 2017 a statista.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the tenth most used social network based on their count of 319 million monthly visitors.

Please wait a moment and try again.\" Web designer and Twitter user Jen Simmons was the first to coin the term \"fail whale\" in a September 2007 tweet. In a November 2013 Wired interview Chris Fry, VP of Engineering at that time, noted that the company had taken the \"fail whale\" out of production as the platform was now more stable. Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or about six full days of downtime). The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.\\n\\n\\n== User accounts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Verified accounts ===\\n\\nIn June 2009, after being criticized by Kanye West and sued by Tony La Russa over unauthorized accounts run by impersonators, the company launched their \"Verified Accounts\" program. Twitter stated that an account with a \"blue tick\" verification badge indicates \"we\\'ve been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved\". In July 2016, Twitter announced a public application process to grant verified status to an account \"if it is determined to be of public interest\" and that verification \"does not imply an endorsement\". Verified status allows access to some features unavailable to other users, such as only seeing mentions from other verified accounts.In November 2020, Twitter announced a relaunch of its verification system in 2021. According to the new policy, Twitter verifies six different types of accounts; for three of them (companies, brands, and influential individuals like activists), the existence of a Wikipedia page will be one criterion for showing that the account has \"Off Twitter Notability\". Twitter states that it will re-open public verification applications at some point in \"early 2021\".In October 2022, after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, it was reported that verification would instead be included in the paid Twitter Blue service, and that existing verified accounts would lose their status if they do not subscribe. On November 1, Musk confirmed that verification would be included in Blue in the future, dismissing the existing verification system as a \"lords & peasants system\". Following concerns over the possibility of impersonation, Twitter subsequently reimplemented a second \"Official\" marker, consisting of a grey tick and \"Official\" text displayed under the username, for high-profile accounts of \"government and commercial entities\".In December 2022, the \"Official\" text was replaced by a gold checkmark for organizations, as well as a grey checkmark for government and multilateral accounts.In March 2023, the gold checkmark was made available for organizations to purchase through the Verified Organizations program (formerly called Twitter Blue for Business).', start_char_idx=62797, end_char_idx=65833, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=15.0),\n",

Tad Hirsch, a student and activist associated with the Ruckus Society, the Institute for Applied Autonomy, and later the MIT Media Lab, built the basic first application to help activists organize protests at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Inspired by TXTmob and other SMS sharing applications of the day, members of the podcasting company Odeo had an \"all-day brainstorming session\" to decide on building a new application. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, claims to have introduced the group to the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter. The developers initially considered \"10958\" as the service\\'s short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability\". Work on the project started in February 2006. Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. PST (UTC−08:00): \"just setting up my twttr\". Dorsey has explained the origin of the \"Twitter\" title:\\n\\n...we came across the word \"twitter\", and it was just perfect. The definition was \"a short burst of inconsequential information\", and \"chirps from birds\". And that\\'s exactly what the product was.\\n\\nThe first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees. The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter\\'s startup until 2011. Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007. Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:\\n\\nWith Twitter, it wasn\\'t clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn\\'t replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.', start_char_idx=2410, end_char_idx=5344, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=13.0),\n",

X also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists and communities, and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature. Although the service is now called X, the primary URL remains twitter.com as of December 2023, with the x.com domain name redirecting to that address.\\nThe service is owned by the American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. It was launched in July of that year. Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world. A signature characteristic of the service was that message posts were required to be brief (originally 140 characters, later expanded to 280 in 2017). By 2012, more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets per day. By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. The majority of tweets is produced by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people. As of October 2023, X is the fifth most-visited website in the world.In October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO. Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for increasing the spread of disinformation, hate speech, antisemitism, homophobia, and transphobia. The platform has been praised for taking a differing approach to content moderation. Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as Chairman and CTO. In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to X and that the bird logo would be retired. In October 2023, the company estimated its value at about $19 billion, down about 55 percent from the purchase price one year earlier. Fidelity at about the same time estimated the value to be down 65 percent from its purchase price.

Bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.

For example, it has been used to organize protests, including the protests over the 2009 Moldovan election, the 2009 student protests in Austria, the 2009 Gaza–Israel conflict, the 2009 Iranian green revolution, the 2010 Toronto G20 protests, the 2010 Bolivarian Revolution, the 2010 Stuttgart21 protests in Germany, the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, 2011 England riots, the 2011 United States Occupy movement, the 2011 anti-austerity movement in Spain, the 2011 Aganaktismenoi movements in Greece, the 2011 demonstration in Rome, the 2011 Wisconsin labor protests, the 2012 Gaza–Israel conflict, the 2013 protests in Brazil, and the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Turkey.The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: In 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter joke trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the film Spartacus (1960) and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they canceled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide. Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.During the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased. A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.\", start_char_idx=78019, end_char_idx=80666, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=6.0),\n",

The government of the Philippines has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics.In 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute\\'s International Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program. As of 2018, Facebook had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including The Weekly Standard. Critics of the program have accused Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its website.Facebook has repeatedly amended its content policies. In July 2018, it stated that it would \"downrank\" articles that its fact-checkers determined to be false, and remove misinformation that incited violence. Facebook stated that content that receives \"false\" ratings from its fact-checkers can be demonetized and suffer dramatically reduced distribution. Specific posts and videos that violate community standards can be removed on Facebook.In May 2019, Facebook banned a number of \"dangerous\" commentators from its platform, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Paul Nehlen, David Duke, and Laura Loomer, for allegedly engaging in \"violence and hate\".In May 2020, Facebook agreed to a preliminary settlement of $52 million ($58.8 million in 2022 dollars) to compensate U.S.-based Facebook content moderators for their psychological trauma suffered on the job. Other legal actions around the world, including in Ireland, await settlement.In September 2020, the Government of Thailand utilized the Computer Crime Act for the first time to take action against Facebook and Twitter for ignoring requests to take down content and not complying with court orders.\\n\\n\\n==== Threats and incitement ====\\nProfessor Ilya Somin reported that he had been the subject of death threats on Facebook in April 2018 from Cesar Sayoc, who threatened to kill Somin and his family and \"feed the bodies to Florida alligators\".

Facebook defended its actions in regards to InfoWars, saying \"we just don\\'t think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go.\" Facebook provided only six cases in which it fact-checked content on the InfoWars page over the period September 2017 to July 2018. In 2018, InfoWars falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were \"actors\". Facebook pledged to remove InfoWars content making the claim, although InfoWars videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos. Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors. Facebook also allowed InfoWars videos that shared the Pizzagate conspiracy theory to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content. In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of InfoWars head Alex Jones for 30 days. In early August 2018, Facebook banned the four most active InfoWars-related pages for hate speech.\\n\\n\\n=== Political manipulation ===\\n\\nAs a dominant social-web service with massive outreach, Facebook have been used by identified or unidentified political operatives to affect public opinion. Some of these activities have been done in violation of the platform policies, creating \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\", support or attacks. These activities can be scripted or paid. Various such abusive campaign have been revealed in recent years, best known being the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the Spam and Fake Engagement teams, Sophie Zhang, reported more than 25 political subversion operations and criticized the general slow reaction time, oversightless, laissez-faire attitude by Facebook.\\n\\n\\n==== Influence Operations and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior ====\\nIn 2018, Facebook stated that during 2018 they had identified \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" in \"many Pages, Groups and accounts created to stir up political debate, including in the US, the Middle East, Russia and the UK.\"Campaigns operated by the British intelligence agency unit, called Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts utilize \"mass messaging\" and the \"pushing [of] stories\" via social media sites like Facebook. Israel\\'s Jewish Internet Defense Force, the Chinese Communist Party\\'s 50 Cent Party and Turkey\\'s AK Trolls also focus their attention on social media platforms like Facebook.In July 2018, Samantha Bradshaw, co-author of the report from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at Oxford University, said that \"The number of countries where formally organised social media manipulation occurs has greatly increased, from 28 to 48 countries globally. The majority of growth comes from political parties who spread disinformation and junk news around election periods.\"In October 2018, The Daily Telegraph reported that Facebook \"banned hundreds of pages and accounts that it says were fraudulently flooding its site with partisan political content – although they came from the United States instead of being associated with Russia.\"In December 2018, The Washington Post reported that \"Facebook has suspended the account of Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of a top social media research firm\" New Knowledge, \"after reports that he and others engaged in an operation to spread disinformation\" on Facebook and Twitter during the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama.In January 2019, Facebook said it has removed 783 Iran-linked accounts, pages and groups for engaging in what it called \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\". In March 2019, Facebook sued four Chinese firms for selling \"fake accounts, likes and followers\" to amplify Chinese state media outlets.In May 2019, Tel Aviv-based private intelligence agency Archimedes Group was banned from Facebook for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" after Facebook found fake users in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.', start_char_idx=70423, end_char_idx=75634, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=2.0),\n",

In September 2017, Facebook\\'s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote the company \"found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 – associated with roughly 3,000 ads – that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\" Clinton and Trump campaigns spent $81 million ($98.8 million in 2022 dollars) on Facebook ads.The company pledged full cooperation in Mueller\\'s investigation, and provided all information about the Russian advertisements. Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have claimed that Facebook had withheld information that could illuminate the Russian propaganda campaign. Russian operatives have used Facebook polarize the American public discourses, organizing both Black Lives Matter rallies and anti-immigrant rallies on U.S. soil, as well as anti-Clinton rallies and rallies both for and against Donald Trump. Facebook ads have also been used to exploit divisions over black political activism and Muslims by simultaneously sending contrary messages to different users based on their political and demographic characteristics in order to sow discord. Zuckerberg has stated that he regrets having dismissed concerns over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Russian-American billionaire Yuri Milner, who befriended Zuckerberg between 2009 and 2011, had Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.\\nIn January 2019, Facebook removed 289 pages and 75 coordinated accounts linked to the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik which had misrepresented themselves as independent news or general interest pages. Facebook later identified and removed an additional 1,907 accounts linked to Russia found to be engaging in \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\". In 2018, a UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee report had criticised Facebook for its reluctance to investigate abuse of its platform by the Russian government, and for downplaying the extent of the problem, referring to the company as \\'digital gangsters\\'.\"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \\'dark adverts\\' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,\" Damian Collins, DCMS Committee ChairIn February 2019, Glenn Greenwald wrote that a cybersecurity company New Knowledge, which is behind one of the Senate reports on Russian social media election interference, \"was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones in Alabama.

In August 2010, one of North Korea\\'s official government websites and the country\\'s official news agency, Uriminzokkiri, joined Facebook.\\nDuring the Arab Spring many journalists claimed that Facebook played a major role in the 2011 Egyptian revolution. On January 14, the Facebook page of \"We are all Khaled Said\" was started by Wael Ghoniem to invite the Egyptian people to \"peaceful demonstrations\" on January 25. According to Mashable, in Tunisia and Egypt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting protesters and led the Egyptian government to ban Facebook, Twitter and other websites on January 26 then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt on January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign.\\nIn a Bahraini uprising that started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime and regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named Ayat Al Qurmezi was identified as a protester using Facebook and imprisoned.In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a political action committee under the name FB PAC. In an email to The Hill, a spokesman for Facebook said \"Facebook Political Action Committee will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\"During the Syrian civil war, the YPG, a libertarian army for Rojava recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against ISIL. Dozens joined its ranks. The Facebook page\\'s name \"The Lions of Rojava\" comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as \"A lion is a lion, whether it\\'s a female or a male\", reflecting the organization\\'s feminist ideology.In recent years, Facebook\\'s News Feed algorithms have been identified as a cause of political polarization, for which it has been criticized. It has likewise been accused of amplifying the reach of \\'fake news\\' and extreme viewpoints, as when it may have enabled conditions which led to the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis.Facebook first played a role in the American political process in January 2008, shortly before the New Hampshire primary. Facebook teamed up with ABC and Saint Anselm College to allow users to give live feedback about the \"back to back\" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates. Facebook users took part in debate groups on specific topics, voter registration and message questions.Over a million people installed the Facebook application \"US Politics on Facebook\" in order to take part which measured responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates. A poll by CBS News, UWIRE and The Chronicle of Higher Education claimed to illustrate how the \"Facebook effect\" had affected youthful voters, increasing voting rates, support of political candidates, and general involvement.The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, connected hundreds of millions of people. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message. By the 2016 election, political advertising to specific groups had become normalized. Facebook offered the most sophisticated targeting and analytics platform. ProPublica noted that their system enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of \"Jew hater\", \"How to burn Jews\", or, \"History of \\'why Jews ruin the world\".Facebook has used several initiatives to encourage its users to register to vote and vote. An experiment in 2012 involved showing Facebook users pictures of their friends who reported that they had voted; users who were shown the pictures were about 2% more likely to report that they had also voted compared to the control group, which was not encouraged to vote. In 2020, Facebook announced the goal of helping four million voters register in the US, saying that it had registered 2.5 million by September.The Cambridge Analytica data scandal offered another example of the perceived attempt to influence elections. The Guardian claimed that Facebook knew about the security breach for two years, but did nothing to stop it until it became public.Facebook banned political ads to prevent the manipulation of voters in the US\\'s November\\'s election. Industry experts suggested that there are several other ways for misinformation to reach voters on social media platforms and blocking political ads will not serve as a proven solution to the problem.', start_char_idx=95896, end_char_idx=100777, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=2.0),\n",

With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.\\n\\n\\n=== Algorithm and design changes ===\\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user\\'s timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm. Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates. The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, nor provide a way to change it back, which they re-affirmed in 2020. However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order. He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.Since 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app\\'s Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\". Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.Instagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update. They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left. Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.In November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\" However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and The New York Times has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it’s confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".Also in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user\\'s feed. The feature was met with controversy from both Reddit users from The Verge, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens. Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.On June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.\\n\\n\\n== Scientific studies ==', start_char_idx=32978, end_char_idx=37520, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=2.0),\n",

The data breach started in July 2017 and was discovered on September 16. Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts.In March 2019, Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users also affected millions of Instagram users. The reason cited was the storage of password as plain text instead of encryption which could be read by its employees.On December 19, 2019, security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a database containing more than 267 million Facebook user IDs, phone numbers, and names that were left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password or any other authentication.In February 2020, Facebook encountered a major security breach in which its official Twitter account was hacked by a Saudi Arabia-based group called \"OurMine\". The group has a history of actively exposing high-profile social media profiles\\' vulnerabilities.In April 2021, The Guardian reported approximately half a billion users\\' data had been stolen including birthdates and phone numbers. Facebook alleged it was \"old data\" from a problem fixed in August 2019 despite the data\\'s having been released a year and a half later only in 2021; it declined to speak with journalists, had apparently not notified regulators, called the problem \"unfixable\", and said it would not be advising users.\\n\\n\\n==== Phone data and activity ====\\nAfter acquiring Onavo in 2013, Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network (VPN) app to collect information on users\\' web traffic and app usage. This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors\\' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014. Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware. In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for \"false, misleading or deceptive conduct\" in response to the company\\'s use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo\\'s privacy-oriented marketing.In 2016, Facebook Research launched Project Atlas, offering some users between the ages of 13 and 35 up to $20 per month ($24.00 in 2022 dollars) in exchange for their personal data, including their app usage, web browsing history, web search history, location history, personal messages, photos, videos, emails and Amazon order history. In January 2019, TechCrunch reported on the project. This led Apple to temporarily revoke Facebook\\'s Enterprise Developer Program certificates for one day, preventing Facebook Research from operating on iOS devices and disabling Facebook\\'s internal iOS apps.Ars Technica reported in April 2018 that the Facebook Android app had been harvesting user data, including phone calls and text messages, since 2015. In May 2018, several Android users filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook for invading their privacy.In January 2020, Facebook launched the Off-Facebook Activity page, which allows users to see information collected by Facebook about their non-Facebook activities. The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found that this included what other apps he used on his phone, even while the Facebook app was closed, what other web sites he visited on his phone, and what in-store purchases he made from affiliated businesses, even while his phone was completely off.In November 2021, a report was published by Fairplay, Global Action Plan and Reset Australia detailing accusations that Facebook was continuing to manage their ad targeting system with data collected from teen users. The accusations follow announcements by Facebook in July 2021 that they would cease ad targeting children.\\n\\n\\n==== Public apologies ====\\nThe company first apologized for its privacy abuses in 2009.Facebook apologies have appeared in newspapers, television, blog posts and on Facebook. On March 25, 2018, leading US and UK newspapers published full-page ads with a personal apology from Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg issued a verbal apology on CNN. In May 2010, he apologized for discrepancies in privacy settings.Previously, Facebook had its privacy settings spread out over 20 pages, and has now put all of its privacy settings on one page, which makes it more difficult for third-party apps to access the user\\'s personal information. In addition to publicly apologizing, Facebook has said that it will be reviewing and auditing thousands of apps that display \"suspicious activities\" in an effort to ensure that this breach of privacy does not happen again. In a 2010 report regarding privacy, a research project stated that not a lot of information is available regarding the consequences of what people disclose online so often what is available are just reports made available through popular media. In 2017, a former Facebook executive went on the record to discuss how social media platforms have contributed to the unraveling of the \"fabric of society\".', start_char_idx=61948, end_char_idx=67101, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1.0),\n",

In March 2019, Facebook sued four Chinese firms for selling \"fake accounts, likes and followers\" to amplify Chinese state media outlets.In May 2019, Tel Aviv-based private intelligence agency Archimedes Group was banned from Facebook for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" after Facebook found fake users in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Facebook investigations revealed that Archimedes had spent some $1.1 million ($1.26 million in 2022 dollars) on fake ads, paid for in Brazilian reais, Israeli shekels and US dollars. Facebook gave examples of Archimedes Group political interference in Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger and Tunisia. The Atlantic Council\\'s Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report that \"The tactics employed by Archimedes Group, a private company, closely resemble the types of information warfare tactics often used by governments, and the Kremlin in particular.\"On May 23, 2019, Facebook released its Community Standards Enforcement Report highlighting that it has identified several fake accounts through artificial intelligence and human monitoring. In a period of six months, October 2018-March 2019, the social media website removed a total of 3.39 billion fake accounts. The number of fake accounts was reported to be more than 2.4 billion real people on the platform.In July 2019, Facebook advanced its measures to counter deceptive political propaganda and other abuse of its services. The company removed more than 1,800 accounts and pages that were being operated from Russia, Thailand, Ukraine and Honduras. After Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it was announced that the internet regulatory committee would block access to Facebook.On October 30, 2019, Facebook deleted several accounts of the employees working at the Israeli NSO Group, stating that the accounts were \"deleted for not following our terms\". The deletions came after WhatsApp sued the Israeli surveillance firm for targeting 1,400 devices with spyware.\\nIn 2020, Facebook helped found American Edge, an anti-regulation lobbying firm to fight anti-trust probes. The group runs ads that \"fail to mention what legislation concerns them, how those concerns could be fixed, or how the horrors they warn of could actually happen\", and do not clearly disclose that they are funded by Facebook.In 2020, the government of Thailand forced Facebook to take down a Facebook group called Royalist Marketplace with 1 million members following potentially illegal posts shared. The authorities have also threatened Facebook with legal action. In response, Facebook is planning to take legal action against the Thai government for suppression of freedom of expression and violation of human rights.In February 2021, Facebook removed the main page of the Myanmar military, after two protesters were shot and killed during the anti-coup protests. Facebook said that the page breached its guidelines that prohibit the incitement of violence. On February 25, Facebook announced to ban all accounts of the Myanmar military, along with the \"Tatmadaw-linked commercial entities\". Citing the \"exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence in Myanmar\", the tech giant also implemented the move on its subsidiary, Instagram.In March 2021, The Wall Street Journal\\'s editorial board criticized Facebook\\'s decision to fact-check its op-ed titled \"We\\'ll Have Herd immunity by April\" written by surgeon Marty Makary, calling it \"counter-opinion masquerading as fact checking.\"Facebook guidelines allow users to call for the death of public figures, they also allow praise of mass killers and \\'violent non-state actors\\' in some situations.In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the Spam and Fake Engagement teams, Sophie Zhang, reported on more than 25 political subversion operations she uncovered while in Facebook, and the general laissez-faire by the private enterprise.In 2021, Facebook was cited as playing a role in the fomenting of the 2021 United States Capitol attack.', start_char_idx=74749, end_char_idx=79319, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1.0),\n",

The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.In August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\". The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok. Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.In February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok. The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.In March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once. Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don\\'t follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.In May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.On October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.On March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. In September 2022, Ireland\\'s Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.After being trialled in mid-2022, Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.In February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments. That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.On July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users\\' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.In April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags.

Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don\\'t follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people. The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation. A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.In April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads. In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.In April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.In August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.In March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.\\n\\n\\n=== Instagram Stories ===\\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user\\'s story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature\\'s similarities to Snapchat. In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the \\'Like\\' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", Recode wrote that \"he likened the two social apps\\' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn\\'t pause it to look at something, you couldn\\'t rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn\\'t have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"In November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.In April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat\\'s functionality.In May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place\\'s Instagram page. A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.In June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.
