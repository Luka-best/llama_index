This is stated in the following excerpt: \"Research and development .....................................................................  $1,201  $1,505  $4,836\". This cost is exclusive of depreciation and amortization, and includes fees, hosting and co-located data center expenses, and other cost of revenue.

This decrease was primarily due to a $609.6 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense primarily attributable to (i) the use of the accelerated attribution method to recognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of the company's IPO Registration Statement which resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring in the second quarter of 2020.\n",

    "In this example, we observed that the search quality as provided by vector embeddings was rather poor. This was likely due to highly dense financial documents that were likely not representative of the training set for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve the search quality, other methods of neural search that employ more keyword-based approaches may help, such as ColBERTv2/PLAID. In particular, this would help in matching on particular keywords to identify high-relevance chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other valid steps may include utilizing models that are fine-tuned on financial datasets such as Bloomberg GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can help to further enrich the metadata by providing more contextual information regarding the surrounding context that the chunk is located in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements to this Example\n",
    "Generally, this example can be improved further with more rigorous evaluation of both the metadata extraction accuracy, and the accuracy and recall of the QnA pipeline. Further, incorporating a larger set of documents as well as the full length documents, which may provide more confounding passages that are difficult to disambiguate, could further stresss test the system we have built and suggest further improvements.
