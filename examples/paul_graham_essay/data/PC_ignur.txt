Ignur

Dwarven Forge Cleric
Hill Dwarf
Male
Tall Enough
Ignur was born in The Belching Wastes and raised in the family business - "Boulderback Stones&Ores", providing rare materials for the construction of The Line.
As the Trifecta Line Company expanded its efforts in mass-production, the family business went bankrupt, forcing Ignur to head out into the world to earn a living. This is what finally led him to Stone-Upon-Hill.

As a child of fire and lava Ignur worships Vallaka - The Flamecaller.
