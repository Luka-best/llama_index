Tamburn School of Sophisticated Elven Magi

The school is well situated in New Soskni.

Magical university in Soskni, run by the Trifectian Magi, specialising in awakening the dormant magical powers that reside in all high-elf children. Most students go on to work directly for the Trifectian Magi as enforcers and mage hunters.

Admission is strict, accepting only 40 students every 45 years. The fee of attendance is extremely high, so the students are often from families belonging to high society. Occasionally they will admit orphans or elves from poorer families.

Current headmaster: Zhagur Aucustin
