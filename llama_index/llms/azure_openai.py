    To use this, you must first deploy a model on Azure OpenAI.
    Unlike OpenAI, you need to specify a `engine` parameter to identify
    your deployment (called "model deployment name" in Azure portal).

    - model: Name of the model (e.g. `text-davinci-003`)
        This in only used to decide completion vs. chat endpoint.
    - engine: This will correspond to the custom name you chose
        for your deployment when you deployed a model.

    You must have the following environment variables set:
    - `OPENAI_API_TYPE`: set this to `azure`
    - `OPENAI_API_VERSION`: set this to `2023-05-15`
        This may change in the future.
    - `OPENAI_API_BASE`: your endpoint should look like the following
        https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: your API key
