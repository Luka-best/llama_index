    "# LongRAG example\n",
    "\n",
    "This LlamaPack implements LongRAG based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15319).\n",
    "\n",
    "LongRAG retrieves large tokens at a time, with each retrieval unit being ~6k tokens long, consisting of entire documents or groups of documents. This contrasts the short retrieval units (100 word passages) of traditional RAG. LongRAG is advantageous because results can be achieved using only the top 4-8 retrieval units, and long-context LLMs can better understand the context of the documents because long retrieval units preserve their semantic integrity."

       "To transform Pittsburgh into a startup hub, several strategies can be employed. Encouraging the youth-driven food boom is one approach, as it attracts young people, particularly those aged 25 to 29, who are crucial for startups. The city should also focus on maintaining its affordable yet desirable housing, preserving historic buildings, and enhancing its bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure to make it more appealing to young professionals. Additionally, leveraging Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) strengths and striving to make it an even better research institution can attract ambitious talent. Finally, fostering a culture of tolerance and attracting investors, despite the current lack of a strong investor community, are also essential steps.\n",

The city should encourage the youth-driven food boom, streamline the permit process for new restaurants and cafes, and focus on historic preservation to maintain its unique character. Additionally, Pittsburgh should capitalize on its pre-car city layout to become the most bicycle and pedestrian-friendly city in the country. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) can contribute by continuing to be a top-tier research university and attracting ambitious talent. The city should also foster a culture of tolerance and pragmatism, reminiscent of its industrial roots, and gradually build an investor community as startups grow and succeed.\n",

Intentional moderates deliberately choose positions midway between the extremes of right and left, often shifting their stance as the median opinion changes. Accidental moderates, on the other hand, form their opinions independently on each issue, resulting in a broad range of views that average out to a moderate position. Intentional moderates' opinions are predictable and acquired in bulk, while accidental moderates' opinions are more varied and individually chosen."
