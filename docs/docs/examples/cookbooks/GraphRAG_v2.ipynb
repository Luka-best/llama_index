    "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex - V2\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",

His eyes sparkled like the stars on a clear night, and his booming laughter could be heard for miles. He wore a bright yellow coat with golden epaulets, a red bandana, and a pair of white boots that had seen their fair share of adventure.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sam's love of adventure and treasure was only matched by his love of music and song. He'd often break into a rousing sea shanty, his voice booming across the waves, and his crew would join in, their voices blending in perfect harmony. The \"Maverick's Revenge\" was a ship like no other, with a crew that was as colorful as the captain himself.\n",

      "Now, Captain Jack's personality was a bit of a mixed bag. He was a bit of a trickster, always looking for ways to get out of trouble or talk his way out of a scrape. But he was also fiercely loyal to his crew and would stop at nothing to protect them. And when it came to finding treasure, Captain Jack had a nose for sniffing out the best booty.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while sailing through the Caribbean, the \"Maverick's Revenge\" came across a mysterious island shrouded in mist. The crew had heard tales of a hidden treasure buried deep within the island's heart, and Captain Jack was determined to find it. With his trusty map in hand, he led the crew on a wild adventure through jungle and temple, fighting off fierce beasts and rival pirates along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, they found the treasure, a glittering hoard of gold and jewels that would make even the most seasoned pirate's eyes grow wide with wonder. But as they made their escape, they were pursued by the infamous Captain Blackbeard himself, who had a score to settle with Captain Jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle was fierce, with swords clashing and cannons blazing. But in the end, Captain Jack and his crew emerged victorious, with the treasure safely stowed away on the \"Maverick's Revenge.\" And as they sailed off into the sunset, Captain Jack raised a glass to his crew, his eyes twinkling with mirth and mischief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shiver me timbers, me hearties!\" he cried. \"We've got the treasure, and we've got the tales to tell! Now let's set sail for the next adventure, and may the winds of fortune blow in our favor!\"\n"

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
    "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
    "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
    "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
    "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.\n",
    "2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.\n",
    "3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
    "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
    "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
    "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
    "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
    "5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage."
