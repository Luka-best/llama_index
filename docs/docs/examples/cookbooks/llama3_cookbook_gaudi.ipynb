This is why, in my opinion, the most innovative and successful companies are often those that are most apolitical. They're not trying to create a particular ideology or agenda, they're just trying to solve real problems and make people's lives better. And that's why, in the end, technology will always win out over politics. It's just more effective.\"assistant|>\n",
