    "NVIDIA AI Foundation models are community and NVIDIA-built models and are NVIDIA-optimized to deliver the best performance on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure.  Using the API, you can query live endpoints available on the NVIDIA API Catalog to get quick results from a DGX-hosted cloud compute environment. All models are source-accessible and can be deployed on your own compute cluster using NVIDIA NIM which is part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\n",

    "Models can be exported from NVIDIA’s API catalog with NVIDIA NIM, which is included with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise license, and run them on-premises, giving Enterprises ownership of their customizations and full control of their IP and AI application. NIMs are packaged as container images on a per model/model family basis and are distributed as NGC container images through the NVIDIA NGC Catalog. At their core, NIMs are containers that provide interactive APIs for running inference on an AI Model.\n",
