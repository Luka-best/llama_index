    "During the execution of a Workflow, `Checkpoint` objects are automatically stored within the `Context` class. By default, `Checkpoints` are automatically created at the completion of a step. At such instants in the Workflow execution, we checkpoint the name of the last completed step, it's input `Event`, it's output `Event`, as well as a snapshot of the `Context` itself. We also store a `Checkpoint` before the emission of the `StartEvent`, but note that running from these special checkpoints are essentially equivalent to the typical execution of a `Workflow` -- we add it here purely for convenience.\n",
