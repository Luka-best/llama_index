    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG, which includes:\n",

    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal vector store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",

Risks also involve safety concerns, such as AI systems violating safety regulations, causing harm, and impacting individuals' rights and opportunities. Furthermore, the misuse of AI, like AI-enabled technology for creating non-consensual images, can have devastating effects on individuals.

      "\n",
      "AI presents both significant risks and benefits. On one hand, it can lead to biased outcomes, lack of transparency, and potential harm if not carefully managed. On the other hand, it offers transformative potential across various sectors, from agriculture to healthcare, and can revolutionize industries. Experts emphasize the importance of responsible AI development, with frameworks and guidelines being established to mitigate risks and maximize benefits.\n"
