    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG, which includes:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal vector store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and [MMR](https://vectara.com/get-diverse-results-and-comprehensive-summaries-with-vectaras-mmr-reranker/), [Multilingual](https://vectara.com/blog/unlocking-the-state-of-the-art-reranker-introducing-the-vectara-multilingual-reranker_v1/), or [User Defined Function](https://vectara.com/blog/introducing-user-defined-functions-for-vectara/) reranking)\n",
    "4. An option to a create [generative summary](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview) with a selection of different LLMs (including [Mockingbird](https://vectara.com/blog/mockingbird-is-a-rag-specific-llm-that-beats-gpt-4-gemini-1-5-pro-in-rag-output-quality/)), based on the retrieved documents, including citations.\n",
