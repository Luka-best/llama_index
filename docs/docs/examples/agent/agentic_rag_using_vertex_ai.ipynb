Our project can be found\\nat https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nAutonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to en-\\nhance and replicate human workflows. In real-world applications, however, existing systems (Park\\net al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023;\\nLiang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023) tend to oversimplify the complexities. They struggle to achieve\\neffective, coherent, and accurate problem-solving processes, particularly when there is a need for\\nmeaningful collaborative interaction (Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Zhou\\net al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023).\\nThrough extensive collaborative practice, humans have developed widely accepted Standardized\\nOperating Procedures (SOPs) across various domains (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; DeMarco &\\nLister, 2013). These SOPs play a critical role in supporting task decomposition and effective coor-\\ndination. Furthermore, SOPs outline the responsibilities of each team member, while establishing\\nstandards for intermediate outputs. Well-defined SOPs improve the consistent and accurate exe-\\ncution of tasks that align with defined roles and quality standards (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001;\\nDeMarco & Lister, 2013; Wooldridge & Jennings, 1998). For instance, in a software company,\\nProduct Managers analyze competition and user needs to create Product Requirements Documents\\n(PRDs) using a standardized structure, to guide the developmental process.\\nInspired by such ideas, we design a promising GPT -based Meta -Programming framework called\\nMetaGPT that significantly benefits from SOPs. Unlike other works (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al.,\\n2023), MetaGPT requires agents to generate structured outputs, such as high-quality requirements\\n∗These authors contributed equally to this work.\\n†Chenglin Wu (alexanderwu@fuzhi.ai) is the corresponding author, affiliated with DeepWisdom.\\n1', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3612, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='7344e95b-e611-4057-baae-591efb231523', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ac392063-3b77-4ca8-878a-50b24610a821', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, hash='651e1e188f95286e9f62a01f04a5b2721e4f3e9c22e5775a87189f8829d7d02e')}, text='Preprint\\nFigure 1: The software development SOPs between MetaGPT and real-world human teams.\\nIn software engineering, SOPs promote collaboration among various roles. MetaGPT showcases\\nits ability to decompose complex tasks into specific actionable procedures assigned to various roles\\n(e.g., Product Manager, Architect, Engineer, etc.).\\ndocuments, design artifacts, flowcharts, and interface specifications. The use of intermediate struc-\\ntured outputs significantly increases the success rate of target code generation. Because it helps\\nmaintain consistency in communication, minimizing ambiguities and errors during collaboration.\\nMore graphically, in a company simulated by MetaGPT, all employees follow a strict and stream-\\nlined workflow, and all their handovers must comply with certain established standards. This reduces\\nthe risk of hallucinations caused by idle chatter between LLMs, particularly in role-playing frame-\\nworks, like: “ Hi, hello and how are you?” – Alice (Product Manager); “ Great! Have you had\\nlunch?” – Bob (Architect).\\nBenefiting from SOPs, MetaGPT offers a promising approach to meta-programming. In this context,\\nwe adopt meta-programming1as ”programming to program”, in contrast to the broader fields of meta\\nlearning and ”learning to learn” (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1993a; Hochreiter et al., 2001; Schmidhuber,\\n2006; Finn et al., 2017).\\nThis notion of meta-programming also encompasses earlier efforts like CodeBERT (Feng et al.,\\n2020) and recent projects such as CodeLlama (Rozi `ere et al., 2023) and WizardCoder (Luo\\net al., 2023). However, MetaGPT stands out as a unique solution that allows for efficient meta-\\nprogramming through a well-organized group of specialized agents. Each agent has a specific role\\nand expertise, following some established standards. This allows for automatic requirement analysis,\\nsystem design, code generation, modification, execution, and debugging during runtime, highlight-\\ning how agent-based techniques can enhance meta-programming.\\nTo validate the design of MetaGPT, we use publicly available HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and\\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021) for evaluations. Notably, in code generation benchmarks, MetaGPT\\nachieves a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) with 85.9% and 87.7% in Pass@1. When compared to other\\npopular frameworks for creating complex software projects, such as AutoGPT (Torantulino et al.,\\n2023), LangChain (Chase, 2022), AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023).\\nMetaGPT also stands out in handling higher levels of software complexity and offering extensive\\nfunctionality. Remarkably, in our experimental evaluations, MetaGPT achieves a 100% task com-\\npletion rate, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency (time and token costs) of our design.\\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\\n1https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metaprogramming\\n2', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2866, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='e2f9322d-c529-478e-8f8f-5114b83df44f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='744ed96f-0e30-4c61-80f1-4327760e4ef7', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, hash='a03ba54f2ec0b4431a584abf98ff1990a95283979a257fadd09d9511d1a51122'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d1adb08a-20c3-4019-98d7-d655c492d8c2', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='055dc5e4c33b187272421cfea1aa2f338b8fe0c864fabcd40ad7b4c4d73fc9fa')}, text='Preprint\\n•We introduce MetaGPT, a meta-programming framework for multi-agent collaboration based on\\nLLMs. It is highly convenient and flexible, with well-defined functions like role definition and\\nmessage sharing, making it a useful platform for developing LLM-based multi-agent systems.\\n•Our innovative integration of human-like SOPs throughout MetaGPT’s design significantly en-\\nhances its robustness, reducing unproductive collaboration among LLM-based agents.

In 1969, Waldinger & Lee (1969) introduced “PROW,” a system designed to accept\\nprogram specifications written in predicate calculus, generate algorithms, and create LISP imple-\\nmentations (McCarthy, 1978). Balzer (1985) and Soloway (1986) made efforts to advance auto-\\nmatic programming and identified potential methods to achieve it. Recent approaches use natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP) techniques (Ni et al., 2023; Skreta et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2020; Li\\net al., 2022; Chen et al., 2018; 2021b; Zhang et al., 2023). Automatic programming has grown into\\nan industry delivering paid functions such as Microsoft Copilot. Lately, LLMs-based agents (Yao\\net al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) have advanced automatic programming develop-\\nment. Among them, ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) utilize a chain of\\nthought prompts (Wei et al., 2022) to generate reasoning trajectories and action plans with LLMs.\\nBoth works demonstrate the effectiveness of the ReAct style loop of reasoning as a design paradigm\\nfor empowering automatic programming. Additionally, ToolFormer (Schick et al., 2023) can learn\\nhow to use external tools through simple APIs. The research most closely aligned with our work\\nby Li et al. (2023) proposes a straightforward role-play framework for programming that involves\\ncommunication between agents playing different roles. Qian et al. (2023) utilizes multiple agents for\\nsoftware development. Although existing papers (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023) have improved\\nproductivity, they have not fully tapped into effective workflows with structured output formats.\\nThis makes it harder to deal with complex software engineering issues.\\nLLM-Based Multi-Agent Frameworks Recently, LLM-based autonomous agents have gained\\ntremendous interest in both industry and academia (Wang et al., 2023b). Many works (Chen et al.,\\n2024; Wang et al., 2023c; Du et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023; Akata et al., 2023)\\nhave improved the problem-solving abilities of LLMs by integrating discussions among multiple\\nagents. Stable-Alignment (Liu et al., 2023) creates instruction datasets by deriving consensus on\\nvalue judgments through interactions across a sandbox with LLM agents. Other works focus on\\nsociological phenomena. For example, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) creates a “town” of 25\\nagents to study language interaction, social understanding, and collective memory. In the Natural\\nLanguage-Based Society of Mind (NLSOM) (Zhuge et al., 2023), agents with different functions\\ninteract to solve complex tasks through multiple rounds of “mindstorms.” Cai et al. (2023) propose\\na model for cost reduction by combining large models as tool makers and small models as tool users.\\nSome works emphasize cooperation and competition related to planning and strategy (Bakhtin et al.,\\n2022); others propose LLM-based economies (Zhuge et al., 2023).

Sec. 3.1 pro-\\nvides an explanation of role specialization, workflow and structured communication in this frame-\\nwork, and illustrates how to organize a multi-agent system within the context of SOPs. Sec. 3.2\\npresents a communication protocol that enhances role communication efficiency. We also imple-\\nment structured communication interfaces and an effective publish-subscribe mechanism. These\\nmethods enable agents to obtain directional information from other roles and public information\\nfrom the environment. Finally, we introduce executable feedback—a self-correction mechanism for\\nfurther enhancing code generation quality during run-time in Sec. 3.3.\\n3.1 A GENTS IN STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\\nSpecialization of Roles Unambiguous role specialization enables the breakdown of complex work\\ninto smaller and more specific tasks. Solving complex tasks or problems often requires the collab-\\noration of agents with diverse skills and expertise, each contributing specialized outputs tailored to\\nspecific issues.\\nIn a software company, a Product Manager typically conducts business-oriented analysis and derives\\ninsights, while a software engineer is responsible for programming. We define five roles in our\\nsoftware company: Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, and QA Engineer, as\\nshown in Figure 1. In MetaGPT, we specify the agent’s profile, which includes their name, profile,\\ngoal, and constraints for each role. We also initialize the specific context and skills for each role.\\nFor instance, a Product Manager can use web search tools, while an Engineer can execute code, as\\nshown in Figure 2. All agents adhere to the React-style behavior as described in Yao et al. (2022).\\nEvery agent monitors the environment ( i.e., the message pool in MetaGPT) to spot important ob-\\nservations ( e.g.,, messages from other agents). These messages can either directly trigger actions or\\nassist in finishing the job.\\nWorkflow across Agents By defining the agents’ roles and operational skills, we can establish\\nbasic workflows. In our work, we follow SOP in software development, which enables all agents to\\nwork in a sequential manner.\\n4', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2757, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='01eade1f-8431-43bf-84c8-26f4de20a098', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7f601270-4026-4597-9329-1adff316d38e', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, hash='37f2b434c0bf9909663b75a8ae8774c97bc6a9fe73f3e73370a5b8aa78e2f34f')}, text='Preprint\\nFigure 3: A diagram showing the software development process in MetaGPT, emphasizing its sig-\\nnificant dependence on SOPs. The more detailed demonstration can be found in Appendix B.\\nSpecifically, as shown in Figure 1, upon obtaining user requirements, the Product Manager under-\\ntakes a thorough analysis, formulating a detailed PRD that includes User Stories and Requirement\\nPool. This serves as a preliminary functional breakdown. The structured PRD is then passed to\\nthe Architect, who translates the requirements into system design components, such as File Lists,\\nData Structures, and Interface Definitions. Once captured in the system design, the information is\\ndirected towards the Project Manager for task distribution. Engineers proceed to execute the des-\\nignated classes and functions as outlined (detailed in Figure 2). In the following stage, the QA\\nEngineer formulates test cases to enforce stringent code quality. In the final step, MetaGPT pro-\\nduces a meticulously crafted software solution. We provide a detailed schematic (Figure 3) and a\\nconcrete instance (Appendix B) of the SOP workflow in MetaGPT.\\n3.2 C OMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\\nStructured Communication Interfaces Most current LLM-based multi-agent frameworks (Li\\net al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023) utilize unconstrained natural\\nlanguage as a communication interface.\\nHowever, despite the versatility of natural language, a question arises: does pure natural language\\ncommunication suffice for solving complex tasks?

We establish a schema and format for each role and request that individ-\\nuals provide the necessary outputs based on their specific role and context.\\nAs shown in Figure 3, the Architect agent generates two outputs: the system interface design and a\\nsequence flow diagram. These contain system module design and interaction sequences, which serve\\nas important deliverables for Engineers. Unlike ChatDev (Zhao et al., 2023), agents in MetaGPT\\ncommunicate through documents and diagrams (structured outputs) rather than dialogue. These\\ndocuments contain all necessary information, preventing irrelevant or missing content.\\nPublish-Subscribe Mechanism Sharing information is critical in collaboration. For instance,\\nArchitects and Engineers often need to reference PRDs. However, communicating this information\\neach time in a one-to-one manner, as indicated by previous work (Li et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023;\\nZhang et al., 2023), can complicate the communication topology, resulting in inefficiencies.\\nTo address this challenge, a viable approach is to store information in a global message pool . As\\nshown in Figure 2 (left), we introduce a shared message pool that allows all agents to exchange\\nmessages directly. These agents not only publish their structured messages in the pool but also access\\nmessages from other entities transparently. Any agent can directly retrieve required information\\nfrom the shared pool, eliminating the need to inquire about other agents and await their responses.\\nThis enhances communication efficiency.\\nSharing all information with every agent can lead to information overload. During task execution,\\nan agent typically prefers to receive only task-related information and avoid distractions through\\nirrelevant details. Effective management and dissemination of this information play a crucial role.\\nWe offer a simple and effective solution- subscription mechanism (in Figure 2 (left)). Instead of\\nrelying on dialogue, agents utilize role-specific interests to extract relevant information. They can\\nselect information to follow based on their role profiles. In practical implementations, an agent\\nactivates its action only after receiving all its prerequisite dependencies. As illustrated in Figure 3,\\nthe Architect mainly focuses on PRDs provided by the Product Manager, while documents from\\nroles such as the QA Engineer might be of lesser concern.\\n3.3 I TERATIVE PROGRAMMING WITH EXECUTABLE FEEDBACK\\nIn daily programming tasks, the processes of debugging and optimization play important roles.\\nHowever, existing methods often lack a self-correction mechanism, which leads to unsuccessful code\\ngeneration. Previous work introduced non-executable code review and self-reflection (Zhao et al.,\\n2023; Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). However, they still face challenges in\\nensuring code executability and runtime correctness.\\nOur first MetaGPT implementations overlooked certain errors during the review process, due to\\nLLM hallucinations (Manakul et al., 2023). To overcome this, after initial code generation, we\\nintroduce an executable feedback mechanism to improve the code iteratively. More specifically, as\\nshown in Figure 2, the Engineer is asked to write code based on the original product requirements\\nand design.\\nThis enables the Engineer to continuously improve code using its own historical execution and\\ndebugging memory. To obtain additional information, the Engineer writes and executes the corre-\\nsponding unit test cases, and subsequently receives the test results. If satisfactory, additional devel-\\nopment tasks are initiated. Otherwise the Engineer debugs the code before resuming programming.\\nThis iterative testing process continues until the test is passed or a maximum of 3 retries is reached.\\n4 E XPERIMENTS\\n4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETTING\\nDatasets We use two public benchmarks, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin\\net al., 2021), and a self-generated, more challenging software development benchmark named Soft-\\n2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese whispers\\n6', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4280, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='0086c64b-7d54-4f7e-8c73-85d8ed408c78', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='0eb06519-1e9f-4ac5-9a17-ec16940bf32e', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, hash='c13a56bbabc81b61dda9b8e80293499421b486f7a4a52ed4c31b60a3c5ad8bd1'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='afd26619-3c0f-44d0-b22b-ae5dd9db21b8', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='76006fa3a24f0109d89ab1945fd625fd4a5162026850e6268fb61645e8afa2f4')}, text='Preprint\\nwareDev: (1) HumanEval includes 164 handwritten programming tasks.

Moreover, as shown in Table 1, MetaGPT outperforms ChatDev on\\nthe challenging SoftwareDev dataset in nearly all metrics. For example, considering the executabil-\\nity, MetaGPT achieves a score of 3.75, which is very close to 4 (flawless). Besides, it takes less time\\n(503 seconds), clearly less than ChatDev. Considering the code statistic and the cost of human revi-\\nsion, it also significantly outperforms ChatDev. Although MetaGPT requires more tokens (24,613\\nor 31,255 compared to 19,292), it needs only 126.5/124.3 tokens to generate one line of code. In\\ncontrast, ChatDev uses 248.9 tokens. These results highlight the benefits of SOPs in collabora-\\ntions between multiple agents. Additionally, we demonstrate the autonomous software generation\\ncapabilities of MetaGPT through visualization samples (Figure 5).

When we\\nexclude certain roles, unworkable codes are generated. As indicated by Table 3, the addition of roles\\ndifferent from just the Engineer consistently improves both revisions and executability. While more\\nroles slightly increase the expenses, the overall performance improves noticeably, demonstrating the\\neffectiveness of the various roles.\\nThe Effectiveness of Executable Feedback Mechanism As shown in Figure 4, adding executable\\nfeedback into MetaGPT leads to a significant improvement of 4.2% and 5.4% in Pass @1 on Hu-\\nmanEval and MBPP, respectively. Besides, Table 1 shows that the feedback mechanism improves\\nfeasibility (3.67 to 3.75) and reduces the cost of human revisions (2.25 to 0.83). These results\\nillustrate how our designed feedback mechanism can produce higher-quality code. Additional quan-\\ntitative results of MetaGPT and MetaGPT without executable feedback are shown in Table 4 and\\nTable 9.\\n5 C ONCLUSION\\nThis work introduces MetaGPT, a novel meta-programming framework that leverages SOPs to en-\\nhance the problem-solving capabilities of multi-agent systems based on Large Language Models\\n(LLMs). MetaGPT models a group of agents as a simulated software company, analogous to simu-\\nlated towns (Park et al., 2023) and the Minecraft Sandbox in V oyager (Wang et al., 2023a). MetaGPT\\nleverages role specialization, workflow management, and efficient sharing mechanisms such as mes-\\nsage pools and subscriptions, rendering it a flexible and portable platform for autonomous agents\\nand multi-agent frameworks. It uses an executable feedback mechanism to enhance code generation\\nquality during runtime. In extensive experiments, MetaGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance\\non multiple benchmarks. The successful integration of human-like SOPs inspires future research\\non human-inspired techniques for artificial multi-agent systems. We also view our work as an early\\nattempt to regulate LLM-based multi-agent frameworks.

However, through active teamwork, a software development team should\\nlearn from the experience gained by developing each project, thus becoming more compatible and\\nsuccessful over time.\\nThis is somewhat related to the idea of recursive self-improvement, first informally proposed in\\n1965 (Good, 1965), with first concrete implementations since 1987 (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1993b;\\nSchmidhuber et al., 1998), culminating in the concept of mathematically optimal self-referential\\nself-improvers (Schmidhuber, 2003; 2009). Generally speaking, a system should learn from experi-\\nence in the real world, and meta-learn better learning algorithms from experiences of learning, and\\nmeta-meta-learn better meta-learning algorithms from experiences of meta-learning, etc., without\\nany limitations except those of computability and physics.\\nMore recent, somewhat related work leverages the reasoning ability of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) and recursively improves prompts of LLMs, to improve performance on certain downstream\\ntasks (Fernando et al., 2023; Zelikman et al., 2023), analogous to the adaptive prompt engineer of\\n2015 (Schmidhuber, 2015) where one neural network learns to generate sequence of queries or\\nprompts for another pre-trained neural network whose answers may help the first network to learn\\nnew tasks more quickly.\\nIn our present work, we also explore a self-referential mechanism that recursively modifies the con-\\nstraint prompts of agents based on information they observe during software development. Our\\ninitial implementation works as follows. Prior to each project, every agent in the software company\\nreviews previous feedback and makes necessary adjustments to their constraint prompts. This en-\\nables them to continuously learn from past project experiences and enhance the overall multi-agent\\nsystem by improving each individual in the company. We first establish a handover feedback action\\nfor each agent. This action is responsible for critically summarizing the information received dur-\\ning the development of previous projects and integrating this information in an updated constraint\\nprompt. The summarized information is stored in long-term memory such that it can be inherited\\nby future constraint prompt updates. When initiating a new project, each agent starts with a react\\naction. Each agent evaluates the received feedback and summarizes how they can improve in a\\nconstraint prompt.\\nOne current limitation is that these summary-based optimizations only modify constraints in the\\nspecialization of roles (Sec. 3.1) rather than structured communication interfaces in communication\\nprotocols (Sec. 3.2). Future advancements are yet to be explored.\\nA.2 M ULTI -AGENT ECONOMIES\\nIn real-world teamwork, the interaction processes are often not hardcoded. For example, in a soft-\\nware company, the collaboration SOP may change dynamically.\\nOne implementation of such self-organization is discussed in the paper on a “Natural Language-\\nBased Society of Mind” (NLSOM) (Zhuge et al., 2023), which introduced the idea of an “Economy\\nof Minds” (EOM), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for societies of LLMs and other\\nagents. Instead of using standard RL techniques to optimize the total reward of the system through\\nmodifications of neural network parameters, EOMs use the principles of supply and demand in free\\nmarkets to assign credit (money) to those agents that contribute to economic success (reward).\\nThe recent agent-based platform of DeepWisdom (AgentStore4) is compatible with the credit as-\\nsignment concept of EOMs. Each agent in AgentStore provides a list of services with corresponding\\ncosts. A convenient API is provided so that human users or agents in the platform can easily pur-\\nchase services from other agents to accomplish their services.

Furthermore, despite gen-\\nerating the most amount of code among comparable frameworks, it remains challenging to fulfill\\nreal-world applications’ diverse and complex requirements.\\nHuman user side A key challenge for users is to interrupt the running process of each agent, or\\nset the starting running point (checkpoint) for each agent.\\nD.2 E THICS CONCERNS\\nUnemployment and Skill Obsolescence MetaGPT enables more people to program in natural\\nlanguages, thereby making it easier for engineers to get started. Over the years, programming\\nlanguages have evolved from punched cards to assembly, C, Java, Python, and now natural lan-\\nguage. As a result, humans have become more proficient at programming, increasing the demand\\nfor programming-related positions. Furthermore, programming with natural language may offer a\\nsignificantly easier learning curve, making programming more accessible to a broader audience.\\nTransparency and Accountability MetaGPT is an open-source framework that facilitates inter-\\nactive communication between multiple agents through natural language. Humans can initiate, ob-\\nserve, and stop running with the highest level of control. It provides real-time interpretation and op-\\neration of the natural language, displayed on the screen and logs, ensuring transparency. MetaGPT\\nenhances “natural language programming” capabilities, and human engineers are the users and re-\\nsponsible for the outcomes.\\nPrivacy and Data Security MetaGPT operates locally, ensuring user data privacy and security. It\\ndoes not collect user data. For interactions with third-party LLMs, such as those by OpenAI, users\\nare encouraged to refer to the respective privacy policies (e.g., OpenAI Privacy Policy). However,\\nwe provide the option of open-source LLMs as backends.\\n25', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3307, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5106cf8b-9ef7-4c77-a67b-4bad87fa96ed', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='29a9f1b1-b6db-4e3b-87db-8ffe65906277', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_path': 'metagpt.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 16911937, 'creation_date': '2024-06-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-06-11'}, hash='7ea2aad73328750734a4051137c7cd797c849fcf0e6143b6ebba5b91615df4b5')}, text='Preprint\\nFigure 11: The system interface design for “recommendation engine development” is generated by\\nthearchitect agent ( zoom in for a better view ).\\nE M ORE DISCUSSIONS\\nE.1 D EEP-SEATED CHALLENGES\\nMetaGPT also alleviates or solves these challenges with its unique designs:\\nUse Context Efficiently Two sub-challenges are present. First, unfolding short natural language\\ndescriptions accurately to eliminate ambiguity. Second, maintaining information validity in lengthy\\ncontexts, enables LLMs to concentrate on relevant data without distraction.\\nReduce Hallucinations Using LLMs to generate entire software programs faces code halluci-\\nnation problems—-including incomplete implementation of functions, missing dependencies, and\\npotential undiscovered bugs, which may be more serious. LLMs often struggle with software gen-\\neration due to vague task definitions. Focusing on granular tasks like requirement analysis and\\npackage selection offers guided thinking, which LLMs lack in broad task solving.\\nE.2 I NFORMATION OVERLOAD\\nIn MetaGPT, we use a global message pool and a subscription mechanism to address “information\\noverload,” which refers to the problem of receiving excessive or irrelevant information. This issue\\nis dependent on specific applications. MetaGPT employs a message pool to streamline communi-\\ncation, ensuring efficiency. Additionally, a subscription mechanism filters out irrelevant contexts,\\nenhancing the relevance and utility of the information.

It uses a system of standardized procedures, much like a well-run company, to ensure each agent knows its role and contributes effectively to a larger goal. This structured approach, inspired by human workflows, helps to minimize errors and miscommunications that can happen when AI agents collaborate. MetaGPT has been shown to be particularly effective in tasks like software development, where it breaks down complex projects into manageable steps and assigns them to specialized agents, such as product managers, architects, and engineers. This method has produced impressive results, surpassing other AI-driven programming systems in both accuracy and efficiency.\n",

These agents communicate through structured documents and diagrams, ensuring clarity and efficiency. \n",

Instead of traditional reinforcement learning that modifies neural network parameters, EOMs use a free-market approach.  In this system, agents that contribute to economic success, and thus overall reward, are assigned credit.  The DeepWisdom agent-based platform and its AgentStore component are compatible with this EOM credit assignment concept.  AgentStore enables agents to offer services at a cost and provides an API for human users or other agents to purchase these services.\n",

MetaGPT simulates a realistic software development company by assigning specialized roles to different agents, such as product managers, engineers, and architects. These agents collaborate effectively by communicating through structured messages and feedback mechanisms, mirroring real-world workflows. This approach has demonstrated superior results in code generation and overall development efficiency compared to previous systems. The success of MetaGPT highlights the potential of incorporating human-like organizational structures and processes into AI systems for improved performance and outcomes. \n",

            "    * **Product Manager (PM):** Defines the task and outlines requirements.\n",
            "    * **Architect:**  Designs the solution and breaks it down into tasks.\n",
            "    * **Project Manager:**  Coordinates tasks and manages the workflow.\n",
            "    * **Engineer:** Executes individual tasks (like coding). \n",
            "    * **QA Engineer:**  Tests and ensures the quality of the final output.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Shared Message Pool:** MetaGPT uses a concept very similar to your \"shared message pool.\" It's essentially a structured history of all the communication between agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Communication Flow:**\n",
            "    1. **Task Initiation:** The process starts with a user request (like \"write Python code for a web scraper\").\n",
            "    2. **PM Role:** The PM agent analyzes the request and formulates a high-level plan.\n",
            "    3. **Architect Role:** The Architect agent receives the plan and breaks it down into smaller, actionable tasks.\n",
            "    4. **Task Distribution:** These tasks are added to the shared message pool, where other agents (Project Manager, Engineer, QA) can access them.\n",
            "    5. **Agent Collaboration:**  Agents subscribe to relevant messages in the pool. For example, the Engineer agent would pick up coding tasks, while the QA agent would focus on testing instructions.\n",
            "    6. **Iterative Refinement:**  As agents work, they post updates, results, or questions back to the pool. This allows for real-time feedback and adjustments to the plan.\n",

            "**Key Points:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Asynchronous Communication:** Agents don't need to directly call each other. The shared message pool acts as an intermediary, making the system more flexible.\n",
            "* **Role Specialization:**  Each agent focuses on its area of expertise, leading to more efficient problem-solving.\n",

This approach minimizes discrepancies introduced by quantization and leads to better alignment with the original pre-trained weights.  Experimental results across various tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation, demonstrate that LoftQ consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-bit quantization settings, and achieves comparable performance to full-precision models while significantly reducing model size. This makes LoftQ a promising technique for deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices. \n",
