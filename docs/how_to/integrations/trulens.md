# Evaluating and Tracking with TruLens

This page covers how to use [TruLens](https://trulens.org) to evaluate and track LLM apps built on Llama-Index.

## What is TruLens?

TruLens is an [opensource](https://github.com/truera/trulens) package that provides instrumentation and evaluation tools for large language model (LLM) based applications. This includes feedback function evaluations of relevance, sentiment and more + in-depth tracing including cost and latency.


As you iterate new versions of your LLM application, you can compare their performance across all of the different quality metrics you've set up. You'll also be able to view evaluations at a record level, and explore the chain metadata for each record.
