Storage
============

LlamaIndex provides a high-level interface for ingesting, indexing, and querying your external data.
By default, LlamaIndex hides away the complexities and let you query your data in [under 5 lines of code](how_to/storage/customization.md).
Under the hood, LlamaIndex also supports a swappable **storage layer** that allows you to customize:

- Document Stores: where ingested documents (i.e., `Node` objects) are stored,
- Index Stores: where index metadata are stored,
- Vector Stores: where embedding vectors are stored.

The Document/Index stores rely on a common Key-Value store abstraction, which is also detailed below.
