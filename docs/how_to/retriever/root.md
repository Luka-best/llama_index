# üîç Retriever
## Concept
Retrievers specify how to look up the most relevant context from an [Index](/how_to/index/root.md)
given a user query (or chat message).  

It is built on top of [Indices](/how_to/index/root.md) and generally defined in an index-specific way.
It is used as a key component in query engines (and chat engines) for retrieving relevant context.
