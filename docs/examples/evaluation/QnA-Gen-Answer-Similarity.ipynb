He was inspired by Terry Winograd's use of SHRDLU and believed that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence. He was excited by the challenge of teaching himself Lisp, which was regarded as the language of AI at the time, and wanted to reverse-engineer SHRDLU for his undergraduate thesis. He was disappointed to find that the AI programs of the time could only understand a very limited subset of natural language, and realized that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts was not going to work. He decided to focus on Lisp instead, and wrote a book about Lisp hacking.   \n",
