      "The author chose to work on AI because they believed that AI had the potential to achieve higher levels of intelligence, as demonstrated by their fascination with the SHRDLU program. They were initially drawn to AI because it seemed like a promising field that could bridge the gap between natural language understanding and computer programs. However, as they delved deeper into AI during their graduate studies, they realized that the existing approaches to AI, which involved translating natural language into formal representations, were fundamentally flawed and could not lead to true understanding. Despite this realization, the author still found value in Lisp, the programming language associated with AI, and decided to focus on it, eventually writing a book about Lisp hacking.\n"
