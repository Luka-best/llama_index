Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services.

Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,\ntransportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting.

As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the\nfinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and\nvoting models.

Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue\nstreams such as our financial partnerships products.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nDelivery Revenue\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants\u2019 and Couriers\u2019 use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery\ntransactions.\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while\npayments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $228 million\nand $490 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and revenue from end-users of $349 million and $934 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive of depreciation and\namortization of $642 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and cost of revenue of $1.0 billion and $2.7\nbillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.\nDelivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\nFreight Revenue\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30,\n2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes.

To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $955 million as of September 30, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\nSenior Notes\nThe 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur debt and incur liens, as", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ab13959-7500-4230-a8a1-9e72920098d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ab13959-7500-4230-a8a1-9e72920098d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "483f8caf-a884-4a2d-87c7-ad7a7e813f35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "a14267126d7c682ab398392f21dcc85e481327dc9b5d0bc2737fa5f6f7e73d52"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed9662fa-d0e1-4bbf-bb7d-4138384d7e31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "56e0fdaf3b471617b58949ce8ff88c639434388d5d7a38973ac02d9118510029"}}, "hash": "1fecbaf8ba701728d3211e14e7a3066637489735f148cfc5a26aa64742439b38", "text": "of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well\nas certain financial covenants specified in the indentures.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $(101) million and $(395) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,\nand $58 million and $(97) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the\nincome tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, by the benefit of U.S.\nlosses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred\nChina and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora and Zomato, and to a lesser extent,\nthe benefit from our U.S. losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily\ndriven by the current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred\nU.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective\ntax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, the valuation allowance on our\nU.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $247 million, none of which would impact the\neffective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through September 30,\n2022.

operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nOur three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\nbelow).

Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary\nreinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our\ncaptive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on\nthese policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River were\ntransferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred\nClaims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we\nrecognized a $103 million charge in our condensed consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed\nliabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and\nSeptember 30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\nthat provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4268, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e33bcac9-d81d-41ad-ba99-d1e754581b89": {"__data__": {"id_": "e33bcac9-d81d-41ad-ba99-d1e754581b89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e11e6890-ff1f-471c-ae9e-cb7c12f0896a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "8f1dd58b0f9c5dbe2176ca0149e2b2fdb205412ca9c42296beee712aa279cd44"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae4b6302-4cab-41ea-8791-edec87b72aa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "6a24034f51364cf6cf39949d82af754a45e17d7b80d42bb376e8cb903f562fb6"}}, "hash": "348b7b9866a42f4d99c51fb06020cacc540b739a257730f28999f40b7acc7b48", "text": "California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument has yet to be\nscheduled in that matter.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\nthan independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able\nto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\n35", "start_char_idx": 4188, "end_char_idx": 6158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73f85a22-6f01-4da9-9cdb-263f20ca7f99": {"__data__": {"id_": "73f85a22-6f01-4da9-9cdb-263f20ca7f99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c4f3267-8c98-43a3-b02c-66cdeded2b96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "309bbf828a2e64f2f709bd3b420c036ec731f2ba0067d7130b2abd1072c35d01"}, "3": {"node_id": "037e1f83-f730-4058-9f3c-b036f7685a8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "3da2fe7de824818956b47b4b94f8920ac1d52e7ff85a82f0b73f280c93f1d026"}}, "hash": "0f092e6ebffea2762e22819385c70d69563a5a416eaf5518a6831e36b7389b30", "text": "On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber.

In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs.

In addition to revenue, net income\n(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow,\nwhich are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies.

Our board and management find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it\nallows us and our investors to assess the impact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\nTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by COVID-19, we implemented\nseveral initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective\nequipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food\ndeliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.

The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\nrelated disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nFor additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note\n1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,\nItem 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $239 million\nas of September 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market\nfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are\nreviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were\nno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where\nwe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in\nwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and\ninterim rulings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $477 million as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.\nAdditionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we\nmay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.

Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid\nholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a\ndriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),\ndecisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent\nSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are\nemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.

In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating\nhistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more\nquickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render\nour products or offerings less attractive.

Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and\nconsumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will\nstabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.

We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2021, and as of September 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $33.4 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease\nproportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be\nable to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we\ncontinue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and\npromotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire\nadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a\nnegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to\nadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or\nmaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to\nachieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United\nStates, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future.

Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our\nbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and\nreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these\nchallenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4430, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "217baf9d-81e1-4f63-bf4c-489bd9c65b70": {"__data__": {"id_": "217baf9d-81e1-4f63-bf4c-489bd9c65b70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204cf9ae-4462-4e54-9cf9-7c18e41b6ae4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "02aba335d02aa66cc96fbf50dabb0febae1ef6fc0c986e9e6077ce8f50e7527c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac49a7ae-60f8-45c7-aeb8-4db78c9c37a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "3a0e6dd6c1c300378a94caf9033033a4510aed23cc540817ba17390556679822"}}, "hash": "0f32adeb3537fe4f2f972f7a108e7886d285de758ff0b2e96b877a42f0a0390b", "text": "financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in\nthe future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition.

We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects.

To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results.

An economic downturn, increased\ncompetition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much\ngreater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas\nthat affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to\nrenew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from\nairports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility\nand reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that\nridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations\naltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits.

Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already\nintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier\nthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners.

Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges\nmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or\nlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19\nmore generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition.

Moreover, any such new\nor upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do\nnot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,\nand results of operations.

Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary\nperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or\nmay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend\nto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses.

The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a\npower outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and\nplatform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,\nand local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and\nsubject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new\nproducts to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile\ncommunications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.\nIf such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for\ndownload. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces\nwill not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users\u2019 permission to track their activities across\nthird-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of\nsuch advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our\nplatform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to\nthe functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our\nplatform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is\npossible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not\nprovide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may\nbe required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c80a711-bb3b-426b-b0cc-677c439c025d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c80a711-bb3b-426b-b0cc-677c439c025d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "404c5467-f8c6-4ae3-a3a5-ca97645bc11f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "64146f95311b344af95e6c1d9d38d3a6814bd304f7a31e8f1f478573c4590868"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1a5c88b-d13b-4cd1-a937-f67d19b4e468", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "87374bb701f7c102728cc77467a8a319981c18271d6604a27d4bf55b75e7d7f5"}}, "hash": "ce52a11512620145298e5cd92e8d6b6e26c21ec268f4b31931dcb182f1ec6cde", "text": "that we do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.

Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may\nnot be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether\ndue to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or\nunavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business.

If the quality\nor convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to\nDrivers, merchants, and Carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the\ntransition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services\nfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical\noperation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data\ncenters may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be\nvulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our\nsystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service\nproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require\nus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of\ndata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch\nto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center\nproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities\nhave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is\narranged.

If we prevail in the\nproceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to\npay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results.

U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,\nand modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations.

However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong.

In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia.

In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to\ncomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 70 countries. We are subject to differing, and\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\nmodel. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how\nwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our\n81", "start_char_idx": 4086, "end_char_idx": 6843, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a249e6ec-7100-47b3-83b5-76643a1db529": {"__data__": {"id_": "a249e6ec-7100-47b3-83b5-76643a1db529", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1168bef-1e97-4691-9388-c08393331aa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "45adca40e8b36242354180469c59f95fedc70b0fb887d5ceb4954988b10d4f57"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4e46bd2-00d9-4649-887e-998f4eb56e71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "4638f6f89d14c2c3e6f48a11eb3d924d42fb4029ab8ffe5979407adc5f882699"}}, "hash": "0f3993ad1f3603a7b51720f1ad0ecbc677b8f06a274eb20341cc09f1b4cf2c58", "text": "platform. We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business,\nespecially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or\ngovernmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and\nimprove air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an\n\u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and\nplan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle\nmiles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations\nin Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to\nprovide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us\nor shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK\nrepresented approximately 8.1% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court\nof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of\nAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4113, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4e46bd2-00d9-4649-887e-998f4eb56e71": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4e46bd2-00d9-4649-887e-998f4eb56e71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1168bef-1e97-4691-9388-c08393331aa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "45adca40e8b36242354180469c59f95fedc70b0fb887d5ceb4954988b10d4f57"}, "2": {"node_id": "a249e6ec-7100-47b3-83b5-76643a1db529", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "0f3993ad1f3603a7b51720f1ad0ecbc677b8f06a274eb20341cc09f1b4cf2c58"}}, "hash": "4638f6f89d14c2c3e6f48a11eb3d924d42fb4029ab8ffe5979407adc5f882699", "text": "passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.

An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct.

Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\nregulation.

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such as\nfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigations\nand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated\njudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered\ninto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC\nCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million\nrelated to the 2016 Breach. In addition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of\nthe 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consuming\nregulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international\nregulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain\ninformation, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million\n($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions from\nsuch entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.

Our data security and privacy practices have\nbeen the subject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree\npursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent\nhow we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other\nactivities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling\napproximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered\ninto a settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September\n2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which\ninvolved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies,\nInc. and Uber B.V. were each fined \u20ac2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted\nin 2018. Additionally, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 Breach.\nFailure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that\nmay impact our business.

For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident\nthat allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of\nthis or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand,\nbusiness disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed\naccess to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class\naction litigation. Moreover, in October 2022, the FTC announced a proposed order relating to the data security incident. The proposed order will be available for\npublic comment, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed order final. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court\norders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face\nharm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not\nbe adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cdd64bd-8452-4dca-972f-7caac6c2e757": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cdd64bd-8452-4dca-972f-7caac6c2e757", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e935061-1a85-484b-b6aa-1a42fa9fadbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "fcdd48929f163f1bd81a7ab15d43bf74f468295ec17719306db539ca356f8172"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb288e4c-6cee-4aa3-84bf-f945258dbed2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "81e836df3e2adccaa0b2418e903d70266faaaef4029b1319c5c5c6ac81c7bce7"}}, "hash": "229e8e4ad3f1f96fdc6ab2332233cb5e308cc873e0002dcab71c65a2531c2aa1", "text": "is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the\nadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.\nIf we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer\npersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement\nfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies.

We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,\nand ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions\nto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a\ntemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation\nsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions.

Further, these proceedings and any subsequent\nadverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.

The results of any such\nlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\nconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources.

These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by\nplatform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4235, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83df3c99-85b4-4709-9361-3d451f493cd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "83df3c99-85b4-4709-9361-3d451f493cd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6bb40ba-c08c-4601-bd67-4e3cfb15b4c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "14475e66072055c0a9bc718f9396b33ba7cb09366f1bc562ca766833dbea08b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d900223b-40c5-4cdb-81a5-6ac49c0ad4de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "b326a93d46b5a10cb24bb71eef3711bcee4b604b7577646a76cd17a0d75c27fd"}}, "hash": "7404496432b2c98f16f05b894f647d9072fde0e528ef32b7953e04f2180d793a", "text": "high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition,\nit is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the\nmaximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new\nvehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth\nprospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs.

If insurance\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects\nof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our\nMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability.
