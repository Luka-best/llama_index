Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d61e4c5-42fd-46e6-9d82-b9d14ca71b77": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d61e4c5-42fd-46e6-9d82-b9d14ca71b77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "308cfc07-ad41-4e41-a478-7e026414407d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "808ec103b00d56bcfba7822943af3eba7ff36a01f73b1e882c2408565ec16b5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b378f2a1-f65a-42b7-8432-3147736d7381", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "dfed57a62a883d9afa84ae079ecc8b4d15c2d81c3abdd4bde3dfa500890887ff"}}, "hash": "f475ee438c1dde1343895fb62b5b7ccc14858e35df20bf46d629a1bf5f5cf669", "text": "specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31,\n2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these\nsecurities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for\ncontractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\nWe did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held, including\ncumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021 March 31, 2022\nInitial cost basis $ 279 $ 281 \nUpward adjustments 4 4 \nDownward adjustments (including impairment) \u2014 \u2014 \nTotal carrying value at the end of the period $ 283 $ 285 \nNote 4 \u2013 Equity Method Investments\nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021 March 31, 2022\nMLU B.V. $ 751 $ 574 \nMission Bay 3 & 4 38 37 \nOther 11 13 \nTotal equity method investments $ 800 $ 624 \nMLU B.V. Investment\nWe reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182\nmillion in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a\nprotracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a\nmarket approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share\nof the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a\none-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for\ncurrency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated\nagainst the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying\nvalue of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30,\n2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.\u2019s earnings", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3907, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2945d02-94ef-44dd-8be2-d18625cc30ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2945d02-94ef-44dd-8be2-d18625cc30ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5067fbb8-5f51-4c34-b768-5fd83dfeda56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "e1b3c01c59087c173c23ee9f7a64d7b385bcb53063c6055f1e801c59d7c85ea7"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d5bb529-3cdf-4253-a0c8-284574337580", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "79859d32632e4693ac56cb53dde574515ad78b7f54a367de949f555a4706c94a"}}, "hash": "941c93bb969483662f418cac3527a9be611127f15752cba6adc7463a310cf755", "text": "as we record our share of MLU B.V.\u2019s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.\n15", "start_char_idx": 3862, "end_char_idx": 3985, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da5759d3-55ea-4cd1-beee-18557bfad0d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "da5759d3-55ea-4cd1-beee-18557bfad0d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6eaa8ae-0fa0-4560-a600-25ee3c244300", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "e8b21f9111ba553cd015ee90ba2875b9768b33941ee8e66b16da7d440af63647"}}, "hash": "e8b21f9111ba553cd015ee90ba2875b9768b33941ee8e66b16da7d440af63647", "text": "The table below provides the composition of the basis difference (in millions):\nAs of March 31, 2022\nEquity method goodwill $ 320 \nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 48 \nDeferred tax liabilities (13)\nCumulative currency translation adjustments (70)\nBasis difference $ 285 \nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-\nline method.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact\nrelated to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022,\nthe income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the\nbenefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due\nto the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets,\nand foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not\nimpact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited.

Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\nthe equity method.\n24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3794, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee9c2b4a-e912-469d-a186-c8c040e0373b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee9c2b4a-e912-469d-a186-c8c040e0373b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "89cbc77c-5715-43c8-84cf-50023dc87a8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "2ef5764210ba5e5cb0d39a11ec1465d4a82953c2482f8f25151a0221b334f6d2"}}, "hash": "2ef5764210ba5e5cb0d39a11ec1465d4a82953c2482f8f25151a0221b334f6d2", "text": "The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amounts\nwhich are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021 2022\nBasic net loss per share:\nNumerator\nNet loss including non-controlling interests $ (122)$ (5,918)\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax (14) 12 \n          Net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (108)$ (5,930)\nDenominator\nBasic weighted-average common stock outstanding 1,858,525 1,953,989 \nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $ (0.06)$ (3.03)\nDiluted net loss per share:\nNumerator\n     Net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (108)$ (5,930)\nNet loss attributable to Freight Holding convertible common shares non-controlling interest, net of tax \u2014 (13)\n    Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (108)$ (5,943)\nDenominator\n     Number of shares used in basic net loss per share computation 1,858,525 1,953,989 \n     Weighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities:\nAssumed redemption of Freight Holding convertible common shares, non-controlling interest \u2014 3,742 \n     Diluted weighted-average common stock outstanding 1,858,525 1,957,731 \nDiluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $ (0.06)$ (3.04)\nPer share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been\nanti-dilutive for the periods presented, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the\nperiod (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2021 2022\nFreight Holdings contingently redeemable preferred stock 13,586 12,377 \nConvertible notes 22,013 18,503 \nRSUs 82,146 116,955 \nStock options 26,073 23,587 \nCommon stock subject to repurchase 28 3,767 \nShares committed under ESPP 2,084 3,361 \nWarrants to purchase common stock 126 73 \nTotal 146,056 178,623 (1)\n(1)\n(1) \n25", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2165, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1980ab26-8107-413b-a100-cd5b9b07debb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1980ab26-8107-413b-a100-cd5b9b07debb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1ec50b8-8d29-4e42-aedc-19cf30c86c8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "bede2ad0d630cc02d4532fe133589a57bffe60aefb34123493d3ccf0c29ff328"}}, "hash": "bede2ad0d630cc02d4532fe133589a57bffe60aefb34123493d3ccf0c29ff328", "text": "Note 11 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Information\nWe determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 \u2013 Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment\nadjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and\nadministrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that\nmanagement does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table below).

As of December 31, 2021 and\nMarch 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax\nmatters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax\nmatters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe California Court of Appeal and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling\nwas made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are\nstill pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent\nworkers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact\non our current operations.

However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently\nunpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and\nsettlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes\nof determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both\nRasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\namount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain,\nwe recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\nGoogle v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of\ntheir respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to\ncompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google\non behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.\nWhether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.\nIn March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the\ntrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to\nperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was\nformally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski\u2019s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May\n16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain given the possibility of appeals, we recorded for\nthis matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with\nregard to such matters.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as\nthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve\nthe applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on\npayments made to such Drivers.\nWe are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to\nclassify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we\ncharge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and\nHMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be\nclassified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a\nsatisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may\nrequire the up-front payment to the Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious\ndefense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation\nand is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussions\nwith HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions,\ntherefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\n29", "start_char_idx": 4106, "end_char_idx": 6388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc8c6181-21a9-48fd-9add-956b7aa296ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc8c6181-21a9-48fd-9add-956b7aa296ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a53090a7-40e5-48dd-8677-41555c054fc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "6be126d36515c3f109f6ff057f608f917852fc7de7c2e57f8e3f0182a1bd0d47"}, "3": {"node_id": "8bc8902c-1e9a-4584-b397-03aebd8a1a6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "7cbd7ba594f506548f215d394d45fbdabdaf6df252c1bd81210e030dd96b1fb6"}}, "hash": "9c2e0ec9e81a2c0bf67f75d7f8c9bac703dde8acb32d8f1a7776ddf07aeb4c95", "text": "Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices, compliance with\nantitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection\nlaws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights.

As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of\nthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated\nLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the\nform of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested\n$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of\nAurora.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving\nvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue\nto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration\nfor these future obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does\nnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation.

In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight\nindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.

On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\nthan independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able\nto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.

Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\nplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of\ntransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX\nShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a\nuseful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n42", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f472bcd2-67f9-4f7c-8325-52790fc064f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f472bcd2-67f9-4f7c-8325-52790fc064f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "962cd6f6-e2ed-4c81-bef2-bdcb5e874dfe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "72bbaaf105fb6deb950893c85b07237e083fb98f0ccaa0a5314de9d3d1441a49"}}, "hash": "72bbaaf105fb6deb950893c85b07237e083fb98f0ccaa0a5314de9d3d1441a49", "text": "Gross Bookings.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million\nas of March 31, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did\nnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds\nand cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.\nChanges in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair\nvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of\ntime after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4215, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2154543-1865-4172-812a-c017fb24af57": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2154543-1865-4172-812a-c017fb24af57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "181c1792-f027-4ca7-97e0-069ebd94616d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "822719dc9235254561d3e736c2b885899417a94877c0f085ad483cf41bf63321"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c9b3945-5c77-4d23-bc9a-3ebe34d9c8e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "1eaad4f24e898a044e208d0e2b0e432393ec5ea767d9d1e452a54408e9fd97ec"}}, "hash": "50f78f2c2636c317c374be31f2131a8d29692cb8048b76bf44bc92b138e03bf5", "text": "rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable\nassurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are\nreviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were\nno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our\nbusiness.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.

Furthermore, to support social\ndistancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required\nand may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models\nof our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts.

The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\nduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the\nadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply\nchains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our\nend-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital\nmarkets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could\nadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05e50d3d-207b-4e9f-be95-8e8f4ce65d4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "05e50d3d-207b-4e9f-be95-8e8f4ce65d4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "381af1e5-e33d-485c-a98a-d0fd697b01bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "eb865045bacc24535ea633411dd5a9bf4c099bb2e34961448b93d29ec6a1575a"}, "2": {"node_id": "414cfcfa-7931-4aa8-971e-727196369f6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "0033883b566bc40b80d410229ee1c3e07eb1268760eb2ef9ba2a0c0e369c02b0"}}, "hash": "fa6c793b02d3beae41fad6533d375a11f0372c08073fc9f25209463b51489f4b", "text": "Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have\nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority\nof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have\nan adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid\nholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a\ndriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),\ndecisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent\nSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are\nemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4217, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d20751df-c776-44ee-ac8f-e527ca79a7b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d20751df-c776-44ee-ac8f-e527ca79a7b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe840947-a2ab-42ed-abae-9923abc1a251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "816e14698abcd9af7509707d23a66392124634eea76a563265d4a2ed630edf52"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d496a2b-740c-4c1f-86c3-d32d74440dbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "baf4ce6d1317ea334ed45895e35b26565ac87dc6316a9ea66a3d740ef9410ed8"}}, "hash": "6062db25547fd5898a36a3cab75a447834b5931a806fa1e3c2d10fe5b4082f09", "text": "Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low.

The\nfailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing\nperiodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\n56", "start_char_idx": 4239, "end_char_idx": 6981, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e7e019d-5fbe-4941-a72e-378403f42016": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e7e019d-5fbe-4941-a72e-378403f42016", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41378818-f558-472f-b406-094a40b71deb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "5fe08ced47179b12ebf2d1ea20126c31e5b3693fbaf1d0c65d7e71aae55a4135"}, "3": {"node_id": "16a1a341-3a34-4efd-b236-efc71a0bfd62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "2de76a8be2212ceb91a90b6dbc2fc9ac467a532dcde926de2a0caa569ab5f5f0"}}, "hash": "76f2c19d03f6bed4254def0d15065e9373c0a24994c1de5a6b474ac452b7e4cd", "text": "Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and\nnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain\nor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\nWe have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled\ndistrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,\nand results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased\ntheir investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have\noccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16a1a341-3a34-4efd-b236-efc71a0bfd62": {"__data__": {"id_": "16a1a341-3a34-4efd-b236-efc71a0bfd62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41378818-f558-472f-b406-094a40b71deb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "5fe08ced47179b12ebf2d1ea20126c31e5b3693fbaf1d0c65d7e71aae55a4135"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e7e019d-5fbe-4941-a72e-378403f42016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "76f2c19d03f6bed4254def0d15065e9373c0a24994c1de5a6b474ac452b7e4cd"}}, "hash": "2de76a8be2212ceb91a90b6dbc2fc9ac467a532dcde926de2a0caa569ab5f5f0", "text": "programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts.

Although\nwe have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such reorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our\ncompany.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If we\nare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\nprospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and\nhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and\ninternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\nour operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31,\n2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States to\nincrease as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including\nengineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires\nperform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing\nemployees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\nrisks of material misstatement.

For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be\nsuccessful and may negatively affect our operating results.\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same\ndegree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022 operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022 the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation\nof our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\n\u2022 laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet\nactivities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,\npayment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and\nbackground checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,\nownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;\n\u2022 competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing\nrelationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\n\u2022 differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\n\u2022 differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\n\u2022 exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\n\u2022 legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a\nlack of clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor\nunions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\n\u2022 regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the\nsame currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022 adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of\nearnings;\n\u2022 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u2022 difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes

As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control.

The broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions\nbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted.

If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely\naffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and\ntypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain\ncities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our\nrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal\nfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of\nDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult\nto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal\ntrends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as\na result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our\noperations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with\ntechnological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,\nand other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense\nlevels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and\ninvestments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our\nexpectations.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we\ncannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are\nsusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in\nwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics\nor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,\nor regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater\ndegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect\nour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew\nexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports.

Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivate\nemployees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent\nwith our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition,\nand operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost\nalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use\none of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public\ntransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity\nand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the\nmerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases\nfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at\nmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products\nand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,\nincreased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these\nincreased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these\nincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants\nto cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash\nreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always\neffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot\nguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a\nvariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,\nwe may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation.

As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\nlimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\n(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed\nby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other\nnetwork operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card\nnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may\nreveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any\ndeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,\neven if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business.

From time to time, companies that use third-party open source\nsoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing\nterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\nmake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor\nour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source\nlicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of\nsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such\nlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions\nof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects\nbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be\nunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code.

Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,\nthe Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these\nexpenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision\nwill be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely\nimpacted by this legislation.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that\nwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where\nwe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and\n$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In\nAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising\ncap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.\nAlthough such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in\nNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect\non January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In\naddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January\n1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4155, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa3163be-e9de-4bd4-9cca-8eca50b190cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa3163be-e9de-4bd4-9cca-8eca50b190cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7266846f-9a9d-4dd8-9f9a-c8ad16b6bbf9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "307de928eb1133a0ef0324e99b35c732fe41bbe9f2fda594f050945658ff3c24"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce328691-738a-4db9-b232-df3a9765d17c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "4f7a40da49ac0e844463cd26e56a647afe50621e371eac5d19de077828a77bc0"}}, "hash": "722bd42092ac3bf8fa85ecaef816eab019ddd9bc9beebb5b256c6f3f7e1d8c10", "text": "minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in\ncountries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities.

In addition, an\nincreasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our\nMobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business\nmodel in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and\nother requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes\nconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,\nand local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nCertain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we\noperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023.

The UK\nrepresented approximately 8.9% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business.

An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow.

Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC.

If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements.

Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps.

These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\nrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or\nother enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our\nability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\nand payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering\nand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.\nGovernment authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk\nmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our\nbusiness.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and other\nU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other government\nagencies, including state AG offices in the United States and other regulators abroad.

We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various\nlawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and\npayment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year.

In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million\nrelated to the 2016 Breach.

Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038.

We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a\nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,\nwe entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved\npayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.

We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April\n2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain\npersonal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security\nincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and\nsignificant liabilities.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\n79", "start_char_idx": 4279, "end_char_idx": 7149, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8f89705-9c99-4140-8fa0-88f9f0252d0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8f89705-9c99-4140-8fa0-88f9f0252d0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e633a9a-3dba-4664-9992-d2e370437a66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "46b70b5c964576783a89a0ce4aff20e5715fc4b1f0c7d091ed175b091b32db8a"}, "3": {"node_id": "cdc96236-b98f-46c9-a16a-8b084c83fcea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "fe1e7d6e1b2a71da06dc9fbff630123f4dd21fd6d7482a27ad8a7eb17085c36a"}}, "hash": "a0307052fca94078cfba2f1a6b856e22b48c8d29a244210f1180591f903a0b76", "text": "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA.

This disclosure may result in a failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in\nthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand.

Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation\nsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner\nin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,\ndisclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived\nfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nfound liable, significant damages.

If any of these legal\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by\nplatform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n80", "start_char_idx": 4239, "end_char_idx": 6869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ca0f947-76e6-43a4-ac05-a04fe6300eb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ca0f947-76e6-43a4-ac05-a04fe6300eb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "edd42fee-b4e1-42a8-aa7f-b4bc9d1b429c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "3418061b7211d6ebf3d776b352992acb0813dd8d52b57295de67798e9c937a20"}, "3": {"node_id": "11b2ba53-a2ed-4959-bd87-fecbd83fa3c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf"}, "hash": "badd2aa1d440f54aa90256f89ff42d99b1364c2850cf6ba443f8070bc37ee804"}}, "hash": "3df24044a4ba8e1c1cc4a60b3c2c425c9af373e06733254a9da8769f1de39267", "text": "We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.

If any other court of competent\njurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may\nincur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure\nto maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other\neffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 2.
