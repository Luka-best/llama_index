On the other hand, generation involves generating new text based on a given prompt or input, often using neural networks or other AI models.\n",

The generator network uses these inputs to produce a generated text that is both fluent and factually consistent with the original source material.\n",

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of neural language model that combines the strengths of both parametric and non-parametric memories to improve its ability to access, manipulate, and generate knowledge. RAG models use pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models as their parametric memory and pair them with dense vector indexes of external knowledge sources like Wikipedia, which are accessed through a pre-trained neural retriever. This allows the model to directly revise and expand its knowledge base while generating text, resulting in more specific, diverse, and factual language compared to state-of-the-art parametrically-only seq2seq baselines. The key advantage of RAG models is their ability to provide insight into their predictions and revisit their knowledge base whenever necessary, addressing some limitations of pure parametric or non-parametric approaches.\n",
