The scheme relies on a continuous influx of new investors to provide the necessary funds to pay returns to earlier investors. It is named after Charles Ponzi, who gained notoriety for using this technique in the early 1900s. The masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically set it up by making promises of high returns to potential investors, creating fake documents to make the scheme appear legitimate, collecting money from investors, using the collected funds to pay returns to earlier investors while keeping a portion for themselves, and continuing to recruit new investors to sustain the scheme.

The money collected from new investors is used to pay the promised returns to earlier investors, while keeping a portion for themselves. The scheme continues by recruiting new investors to provide funds for the promised returns and to pay themselves. Some of the funds may also be used for personal expenses.
