They also wanted a name that was memorable and easy to pronounce, and that reflected their focus on startups and venture capital. The name Y Combinator was chosen because it was a cool trick in the lambda calculus, the programming language used to write the code for YC's seed editor. The founders also liked the color orange, which they thought would help them stand out in the crowded venture capital industry.\n\nThe founders of Y Combinator, Julian Assange and Aaron Swartz, were not organized as a fund. They funded the company with their own money, which went right by 99% of readers. However, they didn't know how VC firms were organized and didn't know how to raise a fund. They decided to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. This was known as the batch model, and it was a distinctive feature of YC.
