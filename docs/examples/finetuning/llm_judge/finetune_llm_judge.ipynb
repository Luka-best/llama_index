    "# Knowledge Distillation For Fine-Tuning A GPT-3.5 Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been recent research that demonstrated GPT-4's ability to closely align to human judges when evaluating LLM generated texts (e.g., see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634)). In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use the `llama_index` library to distill knowledge from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 so that the smaller GPT-3.5 becomes closer to GPT-4 performance; and by proxy, closer to human judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate datasets: `train` and `test`\n",
    "2. Perform knowledge distillation (using `train`)\n",
    "3. Evaluate the distilled model  on `test`"

The work we need to do in this step, therefore, is to build a set of generated texts that our LLM judges will judge. More specifically, we will follow the \"pairwise comparison\" evaluation design pattern, where one text generation is passed to an LLM judge that is subsequently prompted to assign a score between 0 and 1 (higher is better).\n",
