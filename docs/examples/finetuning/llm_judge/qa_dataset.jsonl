I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something.\n\nAfter", "llama2-7b-chat": "\nBefore college, the author worked on writing and programming, specifically writing essays and spam filters, and also painted.\n\nOriginal Answer: \nThe two main things the author worked on before college were writing and programming.", "falcon-7b-instruct": "\n1.

The mention of Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a project that was built using Lisp, further reinforces this association. Therefore, the refined answer focuses specifically on Lisp's connection to AI research during this time period.", "falcon-7b-instruct": "<strong>Lisp</strong> was regarded as the language of AI during the time period mentioned in the context."}}

{"question": "What was the author's experience like as a student at the Accademia?", "answers": {"mistral-7b-instruct": "\n\nThe author's experience as a student at the Accademia was not positive. Despite the niceness of the students and faculty, there was a lack of focus on learning and a general agreement to not teach or learn anything meaningful. The students would spend their time chatting or imitating things they'd seen in American art magazines, while the model, who lived down the street from the author, would pose for them. The author found this pattern conspicuous and disappointing, as they had been hoping to learn about a prestigious subject and were instead spending their time in a 19th century atelier-like setting. However, the author was able to apply to the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence and was invited to take the entrance exam, which they passed.

The author also mentions that they were disappointed with the school and decided to leave after the first year.\n\nOriginal Answer:\nThe author's experience as a student at the Accademia was not very positive. They mention that the students and faculty in the painting department were \"the nicest people you could imagine,\" but the author felt that the students weren't being taught anything and the faculty weren't requiring them to learn anything.

The author's interest in Lisp was sparked by their experience of living in Florence, where they saw the language in action in everyday life. The author was particularly fascinated by the way that simple verbs could be used to create complex ideas, and this inspired them to explore the language further. Additionally, the author was interested in the way that Lisp was used in the art world, and they saw parallels between the way that artists used the language to create complex images and the way that programmers used it to create complex software.
