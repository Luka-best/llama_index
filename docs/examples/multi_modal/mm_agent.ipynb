    "# [Beta] Multi-modal ReAct Agent\n",

    "In this tutorial we show you how to construct a multi-modal ReAct agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an agent that can take in both text and images as the input task definition, and go through chain-of-thought + tool use to try to solve the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented with our lower-level Agent API, allowing us to explicitly step through the ReAct loop to show you what's happening in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show two use cases:\n",
    "1. **RAG Agent**: Given text/images, can query a RAG pipeline to lookup the answers. (given a screenshot from OpenAI Dev Day 2023)\n",
    "2. **Web Agent**: Given text/images, can query a web tool to lookup relevant information from the web (given a picture of shoes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This is explicitly a beta feature, the abstractions will likely change over time! \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This currently only works with GPT-4V."
