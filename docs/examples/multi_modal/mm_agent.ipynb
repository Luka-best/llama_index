    "# [Beta] Multi-modal ReAct Agent\n",

    "In this tutorial we show you how to construct a multi-modal ReAct agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an agent that can take in both text and images as the input task definition, and go through chain-of-thought + tool use to try to solve the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented with our lower-level Agent API, allowing us to explicitly step through the ReAct loop to show you what's happening in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show two use cases:\n",
    "1. **RAG Agent**: Given text/images, can query a RAG pipeline to lookup the answers. (given a screenshot from OpenAI Dev Day 2023)\n",
    "2. **Web Agent**: Given text/images, can query a web tool to lookup relevant information from the web (given a picture of shoes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This is explicitly a beta feature, the abstractions will likely change over time! \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This currently only works with GPT-4V."

Whether you\\'re running a half marathon or going out on a date, these will serve you well. The price tag is heavy but they are a good value due to the hundreds of miles you will get out of them.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>The shoe is lightweight, breathable, and comfortable making it the only shoe to date I would wear without a sock. I would not recommend it to anyone in a really wet climate as these don\\'t mix well with rain.</p>\\n<p>Price tag aside, these were the first Adidas Boost I purchased. I instantly fell in love and now own 7 different models.</p>\\n<h2>The Adidas Ultraboost for both short and long runs</h2>\\n<p>After putting over 500 miles on these shoes, the Ultraboost has served me well for both short and long runs.

      "1. The Adidas Ultraboost is praised for being versatile, suitable for both running and casual wear. It is considered expensive but offers good value due to its durability and the number of miles one can get out of them.

      "2. The Adidas Ultraboost 22 is noted for its popularity as a sneaker rather than just a running shoe. It is described as super comfortable and plush, with a design that has received a lot of care and thought. The shoe is recommended for its comfort but may not be suitable for those looking for a tighter upper or a shoe specifically optimized for speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Adidas Ultraboost 2020 is recognized as a good daily trainer and a fashionable shoe. It competes with other premium running shoes but is slightly more expensive, with some other models arguably offering more running technology. The shoe is comfortable for everyday wear and has a responsive sole unit with good energy return. The Continental Stretchweb outsole provides superior grip. However, the shoe may not be the best choice for running on surfaces like crushed gravel, as it does not provide enough protection from feeling the rocks underfoot.\n",

The price tag is heavy but they are a good value due to the hundreds of miles you will get out of them.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>The shoe is lightweight, breathable, and comfortable making it the only shoe to date I would wear without a sock. I would not recommend it to anyone in a really wet climate as these don\\'t mix well with rain.</p>\\n<p>Price tag aside, these were the first Adidas Boost I purchased.

It is a popular everyday shoe for thousands of people. This is the type of shoe that people recognize on the street, even if they don’t run.</p><p>In fact, when I wore them to school, my students recognized them right off.

But white shoes get dirty no matter what you do.</p><p>Beyond the color, the design and look of the shoe is nice, and it has a very appealing single-piece look.</p><p>When I first put them on, they were incredibly comfortable for wearing around the house. When I wore them for a full day at school, they were very comfortable.</p><p>Cushioned, but not too soft, and they look great with a work outfit. <strong>Upon my first run with them, they were adequate but not exceptional</strong>.</p><h2>Adidas UltraBoost 2020 Sole Unit</h2><div>\\n<p>Adidas UltraBoost 2020 – Medial Side</p></div><p>The name of the shoe is based off the sole unit, so this is really where Adidas put most of their effort.
