      "Berlin's history dates back to the early 13th century when it was founded as a small settlement. In 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg entered into a personal union with the Duchy of Prussia, and in 1701, they formed the Kingdom of Prussia with Berlin as its capital. The city grew and merged with neighboring cities, becoming a center of the Enlightenment under the rule of Frederick the Great in the 18th century.\n",

After the war, Berlin was divided into East and West Berlin, with the former under Soviet control and the latter under the control of the United States, United Kingdom, and France. The Berlin Wall was built in 1961, physically and ideologically dividing the city until its fall in 1989. Following the reunification of Germany in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of a unified Germany and has since continued to grow and develop as a major global city.\n"
