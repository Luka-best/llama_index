      "prev_section_summary: In this section, the narrator, Nick Carraway, notices that the lights in Gatsby's house are not on one Saturday night, signaling the end of Gatsby's extravagant parties. When Nick goes to check on Gatsby, he is met by an unfamiliar butler who is rude and uncooperative. Nick learns from his Finn (a servant) that Gatsby had fired all his previous servants and replaced them with new ones who do not go into town and are not considered traditional servants. Gatsby later calls Nick and explains that he fired his servants to prevent gossip and that Daisy often visits him in the afternoons. Gatsby also mentions that the new people in his house are siblings whom his associate, Wolfshiem, wanted to help.\n",
      "section_summary: In this section, the narrator is speaking with someone about firing their servants and the presence of Daisy at their house. They receive a phone call from Daisy, who seems relieved that the narrator is coming to lunch. The next day, the narrator describes the hot weather and a brief encounter with a woman on the train. The conductor also comments on the heat. The section does not mention any specific key topics or entities.\n",
