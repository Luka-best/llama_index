    "A user query can be transformed and decomposed in many ways before being executed as part of a RAG query engine, agent, or any other pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we show you different ways to transform, decompose, and rewrite queries. Each technique might be applicable for different use cases!\n",

    "1. **Sub-Questions**: Decompose queries into multiple sub-questions over different tools (identified by their metadata)\n",
    "2. **Routing**: Keep the query, but identify the relevant subset of tools that the query applies to.\n",
    "3. **Query-Rewriting**: Keep the tools, but rewrite the query in a variety of different ways to execute against the same tools.\n",
    "4. **One-Step Query Transform**: Transform the query into another query given input prompt."
