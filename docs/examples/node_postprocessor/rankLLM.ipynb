Meanwhile, other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889. He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning. In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as le fou roux \"the redheaded madman\"; Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March; in April, Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home. Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\"Van Gogh gave his 1889 Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away.

Van Gogh prepared for Gauguin's arrival by painting four versions of Sunflowers in one week. \"In the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin,\" he wrote in a letter to Theo, \"I'd like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large Sunflowers.\"When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study The Poet Against a Starry Sky.In preparation for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September, he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October and, in November, the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten. Their first joint outdoor venture was at the Alyscamps, when they produced the pendants Les Alyscamps.</td>\n",

The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was his portrait of Van Gogh.Van Gogh and Gauguin visited Montpellier in December 1888, where they saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Musée Fabre. Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of \"excessive tension\", rapidly headed towards crisis point.<br><br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t\\t<br>\\t\\t<br><br><br>==== Hospital in Arles (December 1888) ====<br><br>The exact sequence that led to the mutilation of van Gogh's ear is not known. Gauguin said, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who suspected the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Vincent realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin recalled that Van Gogh followed him after he left for a walk and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand.\"</td>\n",

Meanwhile, other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889. He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning. In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as le fou roux \"the redheaded madman\"; Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March; in April, Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home. Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\"Van Gogh gave his 1889 Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey to Dr Rey.
