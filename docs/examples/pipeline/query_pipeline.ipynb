    "# An Introduction to LlamaIndex Query Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "LlamaIndex provides a declarative query API that allows you to chain together different modules in order to orchestrate simple-to-advanced workflows over your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is centered around our `QueryPipeline` abstraction. Load in a variety of modules (from LLMs to prompts to retrievers to other pipelines), connect them all together into a sequential chain or DAG, and run it end2end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: You can orchestrate all these workflows without the declarative pipeline abstraction (by using the modules imperatively and writing your own functions). So what are the advantages of `QueryPipeline`? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Express common workflows with fewer lines of code/boilerplate\n",
    "- Greater readability\n",
    "- Greater parity / better integration points with common low-code / no-code solutions (e.g. LangFlow)\n",
    "- [In the future] A declarative interface allows easy serializability of pipeline components, providing portability of pipelines/easier deployment to different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook we give you an introduction to our `QueryPipeline` interface and show you some basic workflows you can tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chain together prompt and LLM\n",
    "- Chain together query rewriting (prompt + LLM) with retrieval\n",
    "- Chain together a full RAG query pipeline (query rewriting, retrieval, reranking, response synthesis)\n",
    "- Setting up a custom query component"
