# Evaluation

## Setting the Stage

LlamaIndex is meant to connect your data to your LLM applications.

Sometimes, even after diagnosing and fixing bugs by looking at traces, more fine-grained evaluation is required to systematically diagnose issues.

LlamaIndex aims to provide those tools to make identifying issues and receiving useful diagnostic signals easy.

Closely tied to evaluation are the concepts of experimentation and experiment tracking.

While evaluating your pipeline, it is important to keep in mind what parameters your system may be sensitive to.
