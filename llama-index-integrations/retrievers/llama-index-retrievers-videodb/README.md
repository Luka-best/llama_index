# VideoDB Retriever 

## Overview
[VideoDB](https://videodb.io) Retriever revolutionizes the creation of RAG pipelines for video content, addressing the inherent complexities of video processing. Unlike text, videos require significant computational resources for parsing visual, auditory, and textual elements. VideoDB Retriever, powered by VideoDB's advanced database solutions, simplifies this process, allowing for seamless RAG pipeline development without getting bogged down by video data complexities.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Obtain API keys from the [VideoDB dashboard](https://console.videodb.io)

### Installation
Install the necessary packages with the following command:
```python
%pip install llama-index llama-index-retrievers-videodb videodb
```

## Building Your Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion**: Upload your videos to VideoDB and leverage its managed indexing for efficient data organization, choosing between semantic or scene-based indexing.
2. **Querying**: Utilize `VideoDBRetriever` to retrieve relevant video segments and `llama-index` for constructing your RAG pipeline, enhancing your LLM's context with video-based insights.

## Next Steps
Explore `VideoDBRetriever`'s configuration options for tailored retrieval, including specific videos, indexing types, and result thresholds. Dive deeper into node management and compilation, transforming text nodes into actionable video segments for comprehensive analysis and presentation.
