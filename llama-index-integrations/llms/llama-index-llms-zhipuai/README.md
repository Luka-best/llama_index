# LlamaIndex Llms Integration: ZhipuAI

### Installation

```bash
%pip install llama-index-llms-zhipuai
!pip install llama-index
```

### Basic usage

```py
# Import ZhipuAI
from llama_index.llms.zhipuai import ZhipuAI

# Set your API key
api_key = "Your API KEY"

# Call complete function
response = ZhipuAI(model="glm-4", api_key=api_key).complete("who are you")
print(response)

# Output
# I am an AI assistant named ZhiPuQingYanï¼ˆæ™ºè°±æ¸…è¨€ï¼‰, you can call me XiaozhiðŸ¤–, which is developed based on the language model jointly trained by Tsinghua University KEG Lab and Zhipu AI Company in 2023. My job is to provide appropriate answers and support to users' questions and requests.

# Call chat with a list of messages
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="who are you"),
]

response = ZhipuAI(model="glm-4", api_key=api_key).chat(
    messages
)
print(response)

# Output

### Streaming: Using stream endpoint

```py
from llama_index.llms.ZhipuAI import ZhipuAI

llm = ZhipuAI(model="glm-4", api_key=api_key)

# Using stream_complete endpoint
response = llm.stream_complete("who are you")
for r in response:
    print(r.delta, end="")

# Using stream_chat endpoint
messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="who are you"),
]

response = llm.stream_chat(messages)
for r in response:
    print(r.delta, end="")

```
