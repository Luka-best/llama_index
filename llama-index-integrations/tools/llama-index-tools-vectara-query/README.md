# Vectara Query Tool

This tool allows agents to make queries to a Vectara corpus using the [vectara_agent package](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-agent)

To use this tool, you'll need the following information:

* `VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID`: The customer id for your Vectara account. If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://console.vectara.com/signup).
* `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID`: The corpus id for the Vectara corpus that you want your tool to search for information.
* `VECTARA_API_KEY`: An API key that can perform queries on this corpus.
